This is a text document. It contains text. Hopefully this text will be found moderately entertaining, or at least not boring. This document is named with my computing ID in the hope of distinguishing it from the commit of another student. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I'm just trying to express my inner woo-girl (as a male I have few chances to do this) while continuing to fill this document with words. Notes from CS 6456: An operating system is responsible for providing an abstraction of the HW to programs and managing resources. Some call it a government, a juggler and a few other things, but I find it a lot easier to just remember two roles. Trying to remember the metaphor gets messy and requires the memorization of significantly more information. My brain can't hold that.
