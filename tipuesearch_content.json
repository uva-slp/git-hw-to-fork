Os dados foram coletados em escola p\u00fablica do Ensino M\u00e9dio, em Bras\u00edlia, onde professores e estudantes utilizam a Plataforma Moodle em atividades escolares, desde 2006. Presentemente, est\u00e3o cadastrados neste sistema, aproximadamente, 3.200 usu\u00e1rios. O referencial te\u00f3rico foi estruturado a partir da Teorias culturais e do desenvolvimento (em que o sujeito \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pelo seu desenvolvimento), Teoria da Atividade (a a\u00e7\u00e3o entre sujeitos \u00e9 sempre mediada por objetos) e Abordagem Dial\u00f3gica (linguagem e pensamento na constru\u00e7\u00e3o de si do outro e do mundo). Utilizamos a perspectiva \u00eamica, ou seja, sob o ponto de vista do sujeito, de sua narrativa pessoal, e nos baseamos na Grounded Theory para tornar sens\u00edvel cada fase da coleta.  Nossa pergunta de estudo \u00e9: quais s\u00e3o as din\u00e2micas de intersubjetividade em processos de negocia\u00e7\u00e3o de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de significados em atividades mediadas pelo uso de Tecnologias Digitais da Informa\u00e7\u00e3o e Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o (TDIC)? Os participantes s\u00e3o quatro d\u00edades de estudantes do ensino m\u00e9dio, tr\u00eas meninas e cinco meninos, entre 17 e 18 anos, do 3\u00b0 ano do ensino m\u00e9dio (self- selected). A coleta foi estruturada em quatro fases, gravadas em \u00e1udio e v\u00eddeo: Entrevista Individual, Atividade F\u00f3rum 1, Atividade F\u00f3rum 2 e Entrevista Epis\u00f3dica (sempre com as mesmas duplas). Foi realizada observa\u00e7\u00e3o em campo, an\u00e1lise documental (PPP e projeto Moodle), acompanhamento dos f\u00f3runs pela plataforma entrevista gravada em \u00e1udio com a professora de Filosofia destes estudantes, que utiliza a plataforma h\u00e1 nove anos e com a coordenadora do laborat\u00f3rio, que atua no local h\u00e1 seis anos. Consideramos ainda os resultados de nosso estudo de mestrado realizado na mesma escola (CEP/IH 11-06/2012, UnB) com quatro professores que utilizam esta plataforma em atividades escolares. Para o f\u00f3rum 1 propomos reportagens pol\u00eamicas extra\u00eddas de webjornais: \u201cEscola Parque abre exce\u00e7\u00e3o para alunos usarem celular, mas apenas numa aula eletiva\u201d e, \u201cEspecialista em novas tecnologias defende o uso de celulares e tables em sala de aula\u201d. Para o f\u00f3rum 2 sugerimos uma quest\u00e3o prospectiva: \"Imagine a Escola do Futuro em 20 anos\". Para a an\u00e1lise dos dialogos foram elaboradas 5 Macrocategorias e 21 subcategorias a partir dos dados. No total, obtivemos os seguintes dados: observa\u00e7\u00e3o 18h; entrevistas individuais 189/ min, intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre as d\u00edades nos F\u00f3runs 115min; entrevista epis\u00f3dica 115min e entrevista com a professora e a coordenadora 156min. A investiga\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 em fase de conclus\u00e3o, os resultados preliminares indicaram que na intera\u00e7\u00e3o, durante a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o das problem\u00e1ticas, os estudantes, primeiramente, definem o espa\u00e7o-tempo (Chronotope), que \u00e9 f\u00edsico, digital e semi\u00f3tico.

Relations between this accuracy measure, personality, cultural intelligence, and experience will be examined. The study is exploratory, but we expect negative relationships between cultural blindness/insensitivity and both openness and cultural intelligence.

Aron &amp; E. N. Aron, 1986; Harasymchuk &amp; Fehr, 2012). These relationships are inherently interdependent (Berscheid, 1999), meaning that partners\u2019 relationship experiences are inevitably linked. Additionally, romantic partners must balance the rewards of having their needs met with the risk of being rejected by one another (Murray, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006). Relational boredom may be an informative and unique context for examining dyadic perceptual processes. Are romantic partners able to accurately detect each other\u2019s levels of relational boredom? Are perceivers influenced by their own feelings? Are certain types of people particularly adept (or inept) at accurately perceiving their partner? What are the relationship outcomes associated with boredom knowledge? Knowledge of a partner\u2019s experiences of relational boredom is likely important for navigating intimate relationships; for example, if John recognizes that Claire feels their relationship has lost its spark, he may try to incorporate new types of dates into their routine, which could increase Claire\u2019s satisfaction with the relationship. On the other hand,John may perceive Claire\u2019s boredom as a threat and react less constructively (e.g., by distancing himself from the relationship), which could decrease Claire\u2019s relationship satisfaction. Therefore, whether and how relational boredom is detected and interpreted has the potential to influence relationship dynamics. The relational boredom literature, nonetheless, is in its infancy, and existing research on this topic has not examined partners\u2019 biased and accurate judgments of each other\u2019s boredom.

To empirically test this question, we examined one instantiation of volunteering that is common at post-secondary institutions across North America: Community Service Learning (CSL). CSL is a form of experiential learning that combines volunteer work with intentional learning goals and active reflection. We partnered with an academic program that randomly assigns interested students to participate in a CSL program or to a wait-list. As part of this CSL program, students are required to engage in 10-12 hours of formal volunteering each week in addition to completing related coursework. To assess the well-being benefits of formal volunteering through CSL participation, we examined the subjective well-being of students from both groups over a six-month period. Using Bayesian statistics, and comparing a "" model to a model specifying a small to moderate benefit of CSL participation, we found conclusive evidence in support of the "" model. These findings diverge from previous correlational research in this area by providing no evidence for the causal benefits of volunteering on subjective well-being. These findings highlight the critical importance of using experimental methodology to establish the causal benefits of volunteer work, such as the experiences provided by CSL programs, on subjective well-being.

When the appeal emphasized agency, wealthier individuals reported greater willingness to give and donated more money to charity. In contrast, when the appeal emphasized communion, less wealthy individuals reported greater willingness to give. These findings could not be explained by relevant demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or gender.

Their effect on adults hasn\u2019t been accurately quantified due to selective reporting of outcomes, miscoding and publication bias. The effects of SSRIs/SNRIs on the health related quality of life (HRQoL) of the patients have almost universally been left unpublished. \n\nRecent research at The Nordic Cochrane Centre (NCC) demonstrated that clinical study reports (CSRs) provided detailed information about serious harms missing in published literature and that within CSR selective reporting also occurred. \n\nThe NCC has access to 69 CSRs and their protocols for double blind placebo controlled studies, corresponding to 11,185 patients on SSRI/SNRIs (on duloxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine , sertraline, venlafaxine  or venlafaxine ER) and 7,338 on placebo. We will quantify suicidality, violence, akathisia, activation and similar events caused by SSRIs/SNRIs and the HRQoL of these patients focusing on adults, using data directly from CSRs.

This developmental difference also occurs when judging immoral actors: young children again prefer the person who is not conflicted, while adults judge that someone who struggles with the decision is morally superior.

Social networking sites have been critical for linking potential supporters and distributing information. In addition to Facebook pages on the Wall Street Occupation, more than 400 unique pages have been established in order to spread the movement across the US, including at least one page in each of the 50 states. These Facebook pages facilitate the creation of local encampments and the organization of protests and marches to oppose the existing economic and political system. '\n\nBased on data acquired from Facebook, we find that Occupy groups have recruited over 170,000 active Facebook users and more than 1.4 million \u201clikes\u201d in support of Occupations. By October 22, Facebook pages related to the Wall Street Occupation had accumulated more than 390,000 \u201clikes\u201d, while almost twice that number, more than 770,000, have been expressed for the 324 local sites. Most new Occupation pages were started between September 23th and October 5th. On October 11th, occupy activity on Facebook peaked with 73,812 posts and comments to an occupy page in a day. By October 22nd, there had been 1,170,626 total posts or comments associated with Occupation pages. The density of Facebook activism is highest in college towns and in state capitals. Major uses for Facebook within the movement include the recruitment of people and resources to local occupations; information sharing and story telling; and across-group exchanges.

As most scholars, in the field of humanities, take intellectual property for granted, the representation of Kant like an intellectual property forerunner is still a dangerously mistaken commonplace. According to Kant's Architectonic of Pure Reason the philosopher is closer to a lawgiver than to an artificer, if philosophy is considered in its Weltbegriff or cosmopolitan concept (AA.03: 542.23-30). Because such a lawgiving is based upon that reason with which every human being is endowed, the laws of reason should be thought as public laws and not as individual, private creations. How could a public law be consistently viewed as an object of private intellectual property? Kant avoids such a contradiction because his justification of authors' right does not rely on intellectual property, but on the meaning and the function of both authors and publishers in the world of the public use of reason. Therefore, Kant's theory of copyright is compatible with the Weltbegriff of philosophy. Furthermore, more interestingly, it is also possible to demonstrate that it is consistent with his general theory of property, as stated in the Metaphysik der Sitten. The following essay, after presenting a short sketch of Kant's authors right as personal right, will introduce Fichte's theory of intellectual property to strengthen the case of Kant's rejection of intellectual property, by comparing his ideas with the theory of an actual intellectual property advocate, like Fichte. Eventually, to read the proposed interpretation of Kant in a wider theoretical perspective, it will attempt to connect it to his general theory of property of the Metaphysik der Sitten.", "title": "Freedom, ownership and copyright: why does Kant reject the concept of intellectual property?"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/um4ye", "text": "", "title": "Reducing Implicit Racial Preferences: II.

The answer of Kant is contained in the fifth preliminary article of the Perpetual Peace and it leans towards non-interventionism: a bad constitution can never justify a war, because it may be the root only of a scandalum acceptum. To understand the meaning of scandalum acceptum we have to become aware that it is a term originating from moral theology, which we should translate into the language of international law. Most of Kant's contemporaries still understood the scandal as the sin of advertising a sinful behavior. A scandalum is only acceptum, however, if the act that inspired others to sin has been done without the intention to give them a bad example. A flawed constitution can only be the occasion of a scandalum acceptum because its legal power does not spread its influence beyond the border of its state. If a nation chooses to imitate the allegedly wrong constitution of another state, its choice only depends on its sovereignty, because it is a matter of internal constitutional law. On the other hand, waging war against another country because of its allegedly flawed constitution is a worse kind of scandal, the scandalum datum, because it involves an international law principle of limited sovereignty according to which every state has the right to assault another state because of its constitution.", "title": "Scandalum Acceptum and Scandalum Datum: Kant's Non-Interventionism In The Fifth Preliminary Article of the Perpetual Peace"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/864tx", "text": "", "title": "Back to the future: authors, publishers and ideas in a copy-friendly environment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mwfnk", "text": "At the beginnings of Western philosophy, Plato meditated on understanding media.

The goal of the present study was to assess whether emotional information could reduce the age gap in the quantity and quality (precision) of representations in visual WM. Young and older adults completed a Serial Image Recognition (SIR) task and a Color-Image Binding (CIB) task. Results of the SIR task showed worse performance for negative than neutral and positive images within the older group, hence enlarging the age gap in WM. In the CIB task, recall precision was lower in the old than young adults, showing an aging decline in the quality of WM representations. Positive images tended to improve precision, but this boost was similar for both age groups. In sum, emotional content did not reduce the age gap in visual WM.

The other paper suggests that all lands be allocated to one of three strategic zones: (1) Innovation Zone, (2) Restoration Zone, and (3) Observation Zone (Aplet and McKinley Component Below). Given this framework, a whole host of social and ecological questions arise about where these zones should occur. We built a spatial decision-support system prototype that uses an optimality algorithm to address these questions and help public-private partnerships draft such a three zone portfolio. The prototype is slated for open-access release upon publication and is built with the goals of expandability, extensibility, transferability, scalability and maintainability. Its breadth presents challenges to fully realizing all of these goals, but it can apply to other three-zone allocation mixes such as (1) alternative energy development, (2) agricultural preservation and (3) nature conservation areas. The geoprocessing engine uses modelbuilder and python tools in ArcGIS. Example tools used include advancements to Linkage Mapper, a connectivity modeling system, a new habitat representation algorithm, and a \"greedy hueristic\" module to pursuing optimality.", "title": "Allocating land to a three zone climate adaptation strategy using a spatial decision support system"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/w5jdr", "text": "", "title": "Pre-Data Collection"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/j6qgz", "text": "", "title": "Predicting Emotional Co-Regulation Strategies: the role of Empathy, Immediacy, Affective Behavior, Closeness and Self-Disclosure"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ct2j4", "text": "", "title": "Mexican &amp; Brazilian Couples: Differents or not in Empathy, Emocional Regulation and Conflict Management"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2n7rs", "text": "", "title": "Attachment and depression effects on the accuracy of self and other perceptions"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/u6ze7", "text": "", "title": "Robustness of the correspondence bias (RCB)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d83vu", "text": "", "title": "Poster for IARR Conference"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qmdc4", "text": "", "title": "Should Mary and Jane Be Legal?

Recent concerns about the reliability of single studies might also apply to meta-analyses, where the selection, inclusion, and coding of studies introduces substantial flexibility in the analysis and interpretation of results. It is essential that meta-analyses can easily be reproduced to allow researchers to evaluate the impact of subjective choices on meta-analytic effect sizes, but also to update meta-analyses as new data comes in, or as novel statistical techniques (for example to correct for publication bias) are developed. Regrettably, research in medicine reveals meta-analyses often cannot be reproduced. We plan to quantify the reproducibility of meta-analyses in psychology by reproducing twenty published meta-analyses. We will examine how much variability in effect size estimates is observed in reproduced meta-analyses, both as a function of subjective choices, as when novel statistical techniques to correct for bias are applied to published meta-analyses. Difficulties in reproducing meta-analyses, or substantial variation between original and reproduced meta-analyses, would highlight the importance of increasing the transparency and reproducibility of meta-analyses. This project has the potential to initiate a discussion about the need to increase the transparency of published meta-analyses, and results may have important implications for journal policies.", "title": "Examining the Reproducibility of Meta-Analyses in Psychology"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4cenf", "text": "", "title": "NiMaNu project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/yx2k8", "text": "", "title": "SHARE Connection Evaluations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p8xjs", "text": "", "title": "Pennycook, Ross, Koehler, &amp; Fugelsang (Dunning-Kruger Effect in Reasoning)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nhtur", "text": "The Mindboggle-101 project contains individually labeled surfaces and volumes from human brain magnetic resonance images for 101 individuals, as well as atlases derived from these labeled brains.", "title": "Mindboggle101"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kgdey", "text": "Mindboggle-101 surface and volume brain atlases (anatomical labels from a population of brains).", "title": "Mindboggle101_atlases"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wzqmg", "text": "FreeSurfer processed files", "title": "FreeSurfer_output"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wprc4", "text": "Mindboggle-101 surface and volume templates (unlabeled images from a population of brains).", "title": "Mindboggle101_templates"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4zce8", "text": "Supplemental materials for the Chess Database as a Research Vehicle in Psychology: Modeling Large Data, Behavior Research Methods", "title": "Chess Database as a Research Vehicle in  Psychology: Modeling Large Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vz7y4", "text": "", "title": "SPSS file"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3cygq", "text": "", "title": "Documentation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/eq37w", "text": "Working session to jump-start the development of resources that we can all use to communicate about SHARE with anyone who might be interested, from librarians to repository managers to researchers to university administrators.", "title": "Outreach Materials for SHARE\u2019s Different Constituencies, Wednesday, July 13, 3:15-4:15 PM, Ashlawn/Highlands room"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zfvwn", "text": "", "title": "Code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vg7rn", "text": "The NYU Data Catalog facilitates researchers\u2019 access to large datasets available either publicly or through institutional or individual licensing.

Further, the majority of touch events co-occur with speech within a 250 msec window pointing to the multi-modal nature of infant-directed communication. Touch events that were accompanied by speech were longer in their duration and had twice as many beats as those touch events produced without speech. Moreover, words that were produced with touches were more exaggerated than words that were spoken without touches; i.e. the former had higher average and minimum fundamental frequency. \nExamining the temporal relationships between touch events and speech through a "" distribution revealed that words and touches were well aligned in their onsets, and the variance of the onset alignment of words and touches was significantly lower in the observed distribution than in the "" distribution. \nMoreover, a semantics-based analyses of the data revealed that the proportion of touches that were congruent with the words that accompanied them in terms of the location of the touch and the meaning of the word was significantly higher than would be expected by chance. \nHence, our findings suggest that touch might not only serve as an accompanying cue to speech; it is also aligned with speech in a way that might be beneficial for the language-learning infant in identifying edges of words as well as the meaning of some words like body-part words that can produced in congruence with the location of the touch.", "title": "Multimodal infant-directed communication:  How caregivers combine tactile and linguistic cues"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2wtas", "text": "", "title": "Manuscript"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hxzbd", "text": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u306f\u3001Critcher and Gilovich (2008, Study 2)\u306e\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8ffd\u8a66\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3042\u308b\u30022016\u5e74\u5ea6\u524d\u671f\u306b\u662d\u548c\u5973\u5b50\u5927\u5b66\u3067\u958b\u8b1b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5b9f\u9a13\u5b9f\u7fd2B\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u884c\u3046\u3002", "title": "Replication of Critcher and Gilovich (2008) at Showa Women's University, Tokyo, Japan"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/r5dfg", "text": "This project evaluates the reliability of an on-line platform to record sequences of keystrokes.", "title": "Keystroke sequences - jsPsych"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t923w", "text": "", "title": "PS1011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/52qjc", "text": "", "title": "Materials for Stimulus-Response Compatibility Experiments for Cohesive Gesture Comprehension"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/svzf2", "text": "", "title": "Declarative Capacity does not Trade-off with Procedural Capacity in Children with Specific Language Impairment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2yme7", "text": "", "title": "Abiotic Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2n5ys", "text": "10.1371/journal.pone.0158519", "title": "Non-native bark beetles per US state"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/e24k9", "text": "", "title": "Native ambrosia beetles per US state"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/67v3y", "text": "", "title": "Native bark beetles per US state"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/swyj6", "text": "", "title": "Non-native ambrosia beetles per US state"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tx2zq", "text": "", "title": "Gini Exercise with Weaver"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/h34yz", "text": "A simple analysis of the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, with STATA code.", "title": "Median wealth of Black versus White married-parent households"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ydc3f", "text": "Data Files for Biogeographic ancestry and socioeconomic outcomes: a meta-analysis of American studies", "title": "Biogeographic ancestry and socioeconomic outcomes: a meta-analysis of American studies"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zxs3p", "text": "", "title": "Data and Poster"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/x9ra5", "text": "", "title": "Bibliography"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bzwjr", "text": "", "title": "Stata Code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/de853", "text": "How common is self-citation in scholarly publication and does the practice vary by gender?

We further find that over the years between 1779-2011, men cite their own papers 56% more than women do. In the last two decades, men self-cite 70% more than women. Women are also more than ten percentage points more likely than men to not cite their own previous work at all.

However, none of the previous studies has reported direct evidence that letters are automatically categorized into consonants or vowels to our knowledge, whereas this assumption is frequently implicitly taken for granted by researchers. We tested this hypothesis several times in the lab in the last years (e.g., Drabs, Chetail, &amp; Content, 2013a, 2013b, 2014).\nIn each study, we used the matching task on letter pairs. Participants performed a nominal identity task in which they had to respond \u2018same\u2019 when two letters had the same name whatever the case (e.g., A-a, E-E). They also performed a categorical identity task in which they had to respond \u2018same\u2019 when the two letters belonged to the same category (e.g., AA, Aa, A-e, G-N). The task order was counterbalanced between participants.\nCritically, in the nominal identity task, negative trials included letter pairs that belonged to the same letter category (e.g., EA, oE, BF, Cd) or not (e.g., AF, Eb). Based on previous demonstrations of interference of nominal identity on physical matching (Posner &amp; Mitchell, 1967), we predicted an interference of categorical identity on nominal matching if letter categorization as consonants or vowels is automatic. It should be more difficult to decide that two letters are different in terms of nominal identity if they belong to the same category. \nIn three experiments, we found that the expected effect was significant only when the categorical identity task was performed before the nominal identity task (magnitude of the effect: ~36 ms). In the reverse order, there was a systematic trend in the same direction (~10 ms), but it was statistically reliable in none of three experiments. Moreover, we observed that the categorical interference effect was different according of the case of letters, with a larger effect for case different pairs (e.g., Ae vs. Ac) than for case identical pairs (e.g., AE vs. AC or ae vs. ac). We conducted Bayesian analyses, but the Bayes Factor fell in the non-decidable zone (BF ~ 1). One possibility is thus that there is a real effect, but that its magnitude is relatively small (of the order of 5-15 msec).\nIn order to gain reliable evidence for H1 or H0 with sufficient statistical power, we decided to replicate the nominal identity task (i.e., without the categorical identity task before) with 500 participants (by mean of crowdsourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk services) and we pre-registered the study on OSF.", "title": "Automatic categorization of letters as consonants and vowels: Evidence from letter matching"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/uzsak", "text": "Raw Three Percent data, node and edge lists, extracted metadata, etc.", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/84wbd", "text": "", "title": "Ethics Approval"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/a8sgb", "text": "", "title": "Data and Syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gz2fa", "text": "", "title": "Reversing Implicit First Impressions through Reinterpretation after a Two-Day Delay"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/q3g8c", "text": "", "title": "Apology and Entitativity"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/26b9r", "text": "", "title": "Presentations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/uht5f", "text": "", "title": "Publications"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t8jn5", "text": "", "title": "Data and analytic code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vdq9j", "text": "", "title": "Replication Report for Second Independent Sample"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hdm62", "text": "", "title": "Replication Report for Second Independent Sample"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/shfa5", "text": "", "title": "Replication Report"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/a5u2d", "text": "Data, Codebooks, and Materials for Converse &amp; Reinhard (in press).", "title": "On Rivalry and Goal Pursuit: Shared Competitive History, Legacy Concerns, and Strategy Selection"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d95pr", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zpjdq", "text": "", "title": "Codebooks"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d89at", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6yj7q", "text": "The data can be found in the original competition website as well (http://tx.technion.ac.il/~erev/Comp/RawDecFeed.html)", "title": "Erev I, Ert E, Roth AE, Haruvy E, Herzog SM, Hau R, et al.

The scope of this line of research has shifted over the years from identifying the basic psychological principles and/or the heuristics that lead to deviations from randomness, to one of predicting future choices. In this paper, we used generalized linear regression and the framework of Reinforcement Learning in order to address both points. In particular, we used logistic regression analysis in order to characterize the temporal sequence of participants\u2019 choices. Surprisingly, a population analysis indicated that the contribution of the most recent trial has only a weak effect on behavior, compared to more preceding trials, a result that seem irreconcilable with standard sequential effects that decay monotonously with the delay. However, when considering each participant separately, we found that the magnitudes of the sequential effect are a monotonous decreasing function of the delay, yet these individual sequential effects are largely averaged out in a population analysis because of heterogeneity. The substantial behavioral heterogeneity in this task is further demonstrated quantitatively by considering the predictive power of the model. We show that a heterogeneous model of sequential dependencies captures the structure available in random sequence generation. Finally, we show that the results of the logistic regression analysis can be interpreted in the framework of reinforcement learning, allowing us to compare the sequential effects in the random sequence generation task to those in an operant learning task. We show that in contrast to the random sequence generation task, sequential effects in operant learning are far more homogenous across the population. These results suggest that in the random sequence generation task, different participants adopt different cognitive strategies to suppress sequential dependencies when generating the \u201crandom\u201d sequences.", "title": "Heterogeneous Suppression of Sequential Effects in Random Sequence Generation, but not in Operant Learning"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ehp3g", "text": "", "title": "Teaching Portfolio"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5yvum", "text": "", "title": "Negativity bias in the development of children's other-regarding preferences"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3h4d2", "text": "Behavioural and eye-tracking data to accompany the manuscript \"The eyes have it: Can perceptual and moral decisions be influenced by eye movements?\" by Newell, Torgersen, Saranu and Le Pelley.

Consistent with research on gender differences in mating behaviors, Kenrick et al. (1989) found that males who are exposed to centerfolds report less love for their partner than those exposed to abstract art, whereas females\u2019 ratings are not influenced by the type of prior stimuli. We will execute a high-powered (estimated power of .95) independent replication using approximately the same measures and manipulations. In the current study, attempts were made to minimize differences between the original study and the replication, however, several differences are worth noting. First, in the original study participants came into the lab in same-sex groups. However, in the current study participants will complete the questionnaires online through Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and will be advised to be alone when they complete the study. Given that the original research was conducted in the late 1980\u2019s, we are also using updated pictures of abstract art (control condition) and male/female nudes (experimental condition) as suggested by the original researcher. With regards to measures, no demographics were reported in the original manuscript, but we included a standard demographic questionnaire. The original manuscript also indicated using suspicion questions, though no exact items were reported. Therefore, the 3-item suspicion questionnaire included in our study was compiled by the current researchers, and may not reflect the exact wording used in the original study. Lastly, we added two attention check questions which were not included in the original study, though such checks are typical when using an MTurk sample. The primary goal is to determine whether Kenrick et al.\u2019s (1989) findings generalize to a new sample of individuals, hence contributing to the question of whether the original findings reflect reproducible knowledge.", "title": "Independent Replication of Kenrick, Gutierres, &amp; Goldberg (1989, JESP, Study 2)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3qdau", "text": "", "title": "EFFECT OF (UN)RESPONSIVENESS OF UNFAIR LEADERS ON EMOTIONAL STATE AND PROTEST BEHAVIOUR"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vuj7z", "text": "The Potential of Neurofeedback - Master's Thesis by Timo L Kvamme (2016), contains a pdf version of the thesis.\n\n This is the Supplementary materials for the thesis along with different verions of the paper made openly avaliable for reproducablity.

Please note that there is also an arXiv preprint with slightly different focus: In the Psychological Science paper we focus exclusively on the paper by ten Brinke, Stimson, and Carney (2014), but were not allowed to mention any of the more general implications of our critique for other studies using the same logic as ten Brinke et al. This is unfortunate, because we demonstrate in our paper how a widely used logic can go astray, such that there are indeed general implications for other studies. Those more general implications are (shortly) discussed in the arXiv preprint. Also, due to tight space-constraints at Psychological Science, all the math is only in the arXiv preprint. On the other side, we discuss 'boosting' only in the Psychological Science paper, but not in the arXiv preprint (because this issue arose later during the review process at Psychological Science). \n\nLinks: \nPsychological Science paper: \n - http://www.ecogsci.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/pub/publications.php\n - http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797615597333\narXiv preprint: \n - http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4240\n\nAbstract of Psychological Science paper: ten Brinke, Stimson, and Carney (2014, Psychological Science, 25(5), 1098-1105) reported that humans detect deceit better if they use unconscious processes instead of conscious deliberations. We show that the study is based on a flawed statistical reasoning. The study was published under a new open-data policy that allowed us to reanalyze their data. Using more appropriate methods we found that unconscious performance was close to chance --- just as the conscious performance. Therefore, the study does not provide any evidence for superior unconscious lie detection.\n\nAbstract of arXiv preprint: Neuroscientists frequently use a certain statistical reasoning to establish the existence of distinct neuronal processes in the brain. We show that this reasoning is flawed and that the large corresponding literature needs reconsideration. We illustrate the fallacy with a recent study that received an enormous press coverage because it concluded that humans detect deceit better if they use unconscious processes instead of conscious deliberations. The study was published under a new open-data policy that enabled us to reanalyze the data with more appropriate methods. We found that unconscious performance was close to chance - just as the conscious performance. This illustrates the flaws of this widely used statistical reasoning, the benefits of open-data practices, and the need for careful reconsideration of studies using the same rationale. \n\n", "title": "No evidence for unconscious lie detection: A significant difference does not imply accurate classification."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hcgew", "text": "", "title": "On submitting files to the OSF in a convoluted manner"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2upwg", "text": "A four-week self-control intervention study.", "title": "Mechanisms underlying self-control training"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7zcgm", "text": "", "title": "Data &amp; Results"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/yrcwq", "text": "This is a study of different agricultural methods in an urban setting", "title": "Intensive agriculture study 2015-2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nhrmq", "text": "I'm not lying.

This is the flower of the orchid tree Bauhinia blakeana, which was first discovered in Hong Kong. What many people may not know is that it is a sterile hybrid, and how and why it ended up in Hong Kong is shrouded in mystery.\n\nOne of the best ways to help uncover the secrets of any organism is by understanding its genetic makeup. Genomics, sequencing of the genetic code of organisms, provides a complete look into the genetic complement of any species. It is also one of the key technologies that will define the 21st century. While Hong Kong has made major advances in this field, the general public has a very poor awareness and understanding of what this field even is.\n\nBy bringing together the emblematic and mysterious Bauhinia flower and the power and knowledge of genome technology, we can build a bridge between science and community\u2014 enlightening our understanding of this plant\u2019s interesting biology and informing and educating the public about this exciting and rapidly advancing field.\n\nTo build such a collaborative endeavor, we are launching the Hong Kong genome project through which we will sequence the genome of the Hong Kong emblem to better understand where it came from; train local students to assemble and analyse the data \u2014 crucial skills needed for this field to advance; and engage the public through local pride.\n\nThis will be the first Hong Kong genome project: funded by the public; sequenced in Hong Kong; assembled and analysed by local students; and directly shared with the public. We also welcome contributions and interest from the rest of the world, hoping this serves as a model to inspire and inform other national genome projects, and aid the development of crucial genomic literacy and skills across the globe, inspiring and training a new generation of scientists to use these tools to tackle the biggest threats to mankind: climate change, disease, and food security.", "title": "The Hong Kong Bauhinia Genome project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2cjsa", "text": "", "title": "Using language for social interaction: Communication mechanisms promote recovery from chronic aphasia"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2as9n", "text": "", "title": "\u6625\u7530\u30fb\u91d1\u4e38\u30fb\u6a0b\u53e3\uff082016, \u793e\u5fc3\u5927\u4f1a\uff09"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/354sm", "text": "Diagrams, logos, flyers, stickers, and other media for Tangible Landscape", "title": "Media"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hpquv", "text": "", "title": "Self-control training and obedient aggression"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nxb9h", "text": "", "title": "TSS sea sediment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gf6hc", "text": "", "title": "LIWC Analysis of Hillary Clinton's Speeches"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3na6z", "text": "", "title": "Effects of time on task and breaks on EEG spectral power - Correlates of mental fatigue may dissociate strain and boredom"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sqr3m", "text": "Review article, outlining the benefits for researchers who share their work openly.", "title": "How open science helps researchers succeed"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mdqz5", "text": "The Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Citizen Science Belleville", "title": "Citizen Science Belleville IRB"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jfep5", "text": "", "title": "Pilot study to select stimuli"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7yhnd", "text": "", "title": "Stimuli"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/symeg", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rb6yg", "text": "", "title": "Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vn2jr", "text": "", "title": "Datasets"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2x3v7", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/37xpe", "text": "", "title": "Demo"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vk5x2", "text": "", "title": "OSF Notes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/w3tje", "text": "", "title": "Code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/equyc", "text": "", "title": "References"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/u4hrk", "text": "This OSF repository houses data collected by Molly King for the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality project on discrimination in housing and labor markets.

Repeated homeostatic adjustments in the brain\u2019s stress systems due to chronic drug administration eventually lead to persistent compensatory adaptations in the structures involved in emotional response and its regulation. Among smokers, these stress neuroadaptations result in dysregulated negative affect when nicotine-deprived and provide the strong motivational press for further smoking that manifests as urge and increased risk for smoking cessation failure. \n\nAnimal models have provided substantial evidence to support this stress neuroadaptation thesis in addiction. However, programmatic laboratory research that examines the stress response in nicotine deprived relative to non-deprived smokers is necessary to confirm that our understanding of stress neuroadaptations from animal models translate to addiction etiology in smokers. Negative affect is the core motivational element of the human drug withdrawal syndrome across additive drugs including nicotine. Unfortunately, much of what we know about these motivationally critical affective processes in humans is based on a narrow range of measures collected in isolation. The examination of the characteristics and neurobiological substrates of negative affect has not kept pace with the rapid conceptual, methodological, and measurement advances in the affective sciences over the past decade. Moreover, complementary methods (e.g., laboratory task manipulations, clinical treatment interventions) and measurement approaches (e.g., psychophysiology, ecological momentary assessment) are rarely combined. \n\nThe research in this application capitalizes on recent research with both animals and humans has synthesized precise laboratory manipulations of stress with sensitive psychophysiological measurement of startle reflex potentiation to parse the affective response to stress into its constituent components. In particular, startle potentiation during unpredictable (vs. predictable) threats holds promise as a biomarker of stress neuroadaptation following chronic nicotine or other drug use. We propose to measure stress neuroadaptation in the laboratory via startle potentiation during unpredictable threat in a validated cued threat tasks among nicotine deprived and non-deprived smokers. Smokers will be subsequently assigned to combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or placebo during smoking cessation treatment and will report on episodic stressors, negative affect, smoking urge, and smoking via ecological momentary assessment procedures. Treatment outcome will be assessed at 2 weeks post-quit. \n\nThe broad goals of this research are to identify etiologically relevant psychophysiological biomarkers of stress neuroadaptation that results from chronic smoking. We evaluate the impact of this stress neuroadaptation on smokers\u2019 real-world affect, urge and smoking during smoking cessation treatment. We also evaluate if NRT can attenuate the influence of this stress neuroadaptation on smoking cessation outcomes via its effects on withdrawal. \n\nPublic Health Relevance:\nThis research will translate neuroscience findings from animal models to clinical research on tobacco dependence in humans.  Its goal is to identify precise biomarkers of etiologically relevant stress neuroadaptations that result from chronic smoking.  This research can aid targeted pharmacological and psychological treatment development and identify processes that are obstacles to cessation of smoking and/or increase risk for relapse among smokers.\n\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (R01 DA033809)\nJohn Curtin (PI), Timothy Baker (Co-I), Megan Piper (Co-I), Daniel Bolt (Co-I)\nDirect Costs: $1,508,145\nStatus: Funded. 08/2012 \u2013 06/2017\n\nFor more information see: http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu", "title": "NIDA R01: Clinical relevance of stress neuroadaptation in tobacco dependence"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/9vurb", "text": "", "title": "videos"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/s5e2b", "text": "", "title": "The Open Science Framework (OSF) at Notre Dame:  Connecting the Workflow and Supporting the Research Mission"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g9cz2", "text": "", "title": "Method and Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c3xhe", "text": "Comparison of Pressurized Water Reactor depletion code validation approaches", "title": "PWR Depletion Uncertainty Meta-Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/uq587", "text": "", "title": "Surprise Over Time (SOT)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/e5awx", "text": "This data was collected using Netlytic (http://netlytic.org).

Specifically, our proposed techniques allow (1) the quantification of evidence, both for and against the absence of an effect; (2) the monitoring of evidence as new studies accumulate over time; (3) the graceful and principled \"model-averaged\" combination between fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis; (4) the principled planning of a new study in order maximize the probability that it will lead to a worthwhile gain in knowledge.\"", "title": "Bayesian Evidence Synthesis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/adfye", "text": "", "title": "Introduction"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rg6sk", "text": "", "title": "Pull request format and Github Issues."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tfymq", "text": "", "title": "Procedure Video"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jf3ap", "text": "", "title": "Data &amp; Results"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c6vgs", "text": "", "title": "Stepfather Involvement and Stepfather\u2013Child Relationship Quality: Race and Parental Marital Status as Moderators"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qsz4k", "text": "", "title": "O SURGIMENTO DA PEDAGOGIA DA ALTERN\u00c2NCIA NO BRASIL: CONCEITO E METODOLOGIA"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/dzqen", "text": "", "title": "Inequality in the United States: Ethnicity, Racial Admixture and Environmental Causes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/grk3c", "text": "", "title": "open_science_papers"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/csd4a", "text": "", "title": "papers"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ntdm6", "text": "", "title": "open_science_presentations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xujrd", "text": "", "title": "posters"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t8bq9", "text": "", "title": "brain_posters"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4z68p", "text": "", "title": "brain_papers"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xbk69", "text": "", "title": "proposals"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4a6n5", "text": "", "title": "Matlab Script"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mvgr4", "text": "", "title": "Minimal group and neural feedback monitoring"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t8w3m", "text": "", "title": "graphics"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/783kg", "text": "", "title": "logos"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pm2qg", "text": "", "title": "Sage_designs_2014-2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6xrqg", "text": "", "title": "halloween_costumes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p8fzj", "text": "", "title": "Related Publications by Co-Authors"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6a3xq", "text": "", "title": "keyboard_mappings_2005"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jcs6y", "text": "", "title": "health_informatics_display"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5qgm9", "text": "", "title": "Aplet Presentation: An Adaptation Portfolio Approach to Managing Climate Risk"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ky59v", "text": "", "title": "Gallo Presentation: Allocating land to a 3-zone adaptation strategy using an SDSS"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p4xfa", "text": "", "title": "Two Presentations to American Association of Geographers, April 1, 2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g8ecd", "text": "", "title": "Higher intuition is related to worse  cardiovascular recovery to competition"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jzeym", "text": "Analysis tools and "" hypothesis generation for the data collected", "title": "analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cxyv7", "text": "", "title": "PedsQL Scores of healthy and hypertensive children and adolescents in Slovenia"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/k9dsg", "text": "", "title": "ENABLING EFFECT OF D2:D4 AND COMPETITIVENESS IN THE OUTCOME OF COMPETITION."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ntx8a", "text": "This is an archive of the data (EEG + behavioural) relating to the study, McLelland, Lavergne and VanRullen (2016) \"The phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predicts the amplitude of peri-saccadic mislocalization\", Scientific Reports", "title": "Neuronal Oscillations vs Saccadic Remapping"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8gmf5", "text": "", "title": "Stories"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/64qj9", "text": "This project provides data set for the publication Subcortical White Matter Changes with Normal Aging Detected by Multi-shot High Resolution Diffusion Tensor Imaging on PLOS ONE.

As the endothelial cells become activated and adhesive, monocytes stick to them, pass between them, and enter the intimal layer of the vessel wall. With the use of Immunomodulators. Majority of immunomodulators like cyclosporine, Sirolimus and Mycophenolate mofetil are being used in renal transplant patients. Some of clinical evidences indicated that use of immunomodulators causes hyperlipidemia and increases the chances of atherogenesis. Whereas in preclinical studies various researchers reported that immunomodulators reduces the chances of atherogenesis. So because of non uniform results in clinical and preclinical studies, this study was designed with a purpose of evaluating role of cyclosporine and ashwagandha in atherosclerosis. Method: Cyclosporine and Ashwagandha at 3 different doses have been evaluated in High Fat diet (1% Cholesterol) induced atherosclerosis in rats. Atorvastatin 2 mg/kg was used as standard treatment. Up to day 28 High fat diet was administered and then from day 29 to day 56 treatment and High fat diet was administered. Biochemical estimations of Serum lipid profile, C Reactive Protein, Malondialdehyde and histopathology of aorta was performed. Results: There was significant reduction in Triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, Total Cholesterol, Atherogenic Index, HMG to mavelonate, C reactive protein and MDA level was observed with treatment of Cyclosporine and ashwagandha. There was significant elevation in HDL cholesterol level and was observed with treatment of Cyclosporine and ashwagandha. Conclusion: Cyclosporine and ashwagandha effectively reduce the risk of development of atherosclerosis.\n\nCite this article as: Gajjar A.V., Deshpande S.S.,Evaluation of antiatherosclerotic and antihyperlipidemic effect of Cyclosporine and Ashwagandha in high fat diet induced atherosclerosis in rats,Journal of Pharmacy Research 2016,10(5),334-342.", "title": "Evaluation of antiatherosclerotic and antihyperlipidemic effect of Cyclosporine and Ashwagandha in high fat diet induced atherosclerosis in rats"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/b265y", "text": "", "title": "Datamap, dataset, variables, and syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7dtf8", "text": "", "title": "Test"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bh69f", "text": "", "title": "poster upload"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/58xqt", "text": "", "title": "APS talk"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kfwbp", "text": "", "title": "Agora, o Nacional!

We obtained an effect size of d = .77 of cue-approach training on choices for go items versus no-go items using similar stimulus materials in a previous study in our lab. The sample size (25) is more than sufficient to detect an effect of the training on choices for go versus no-go items using a one-sample t-test according to a power analysis[3]. However, we will use a repeated-measures logistic regression as our main analysis instead of a t-test in line with previous work. Recruitment will take place via the Radboud Research Participation System. Exclusion criteria are that participants should have no food restrictions/allergies, and have not participated in similar studies. Participants who bid less than \u20ac0.25 on auction items over 40 times will be excluded. Participants are asked not to consume any food items for at least three hours before the experiment commences. Sessions will last approximately one hour in total and will be conducted for either a \u20ac10 reimbursement or course credits.\n\nProcedure and Measures\nIn both sub-studies, participants are shown to a pantry where fruits and vegetables are stalled, receive \u20ac2, and are asked to give their informed consent. Then, they will practice and bid on 30 fruit and 30 vegetable items (one can be bought later) in a random-ordered Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction (which measures their Willingness To Pay: WTP, indicating subjective value[4,5]) using a slider that ranges from \u20ac0 to \u20ac2. After this phase, all items are separated per category (fruit/vegetable) and are ordered from high (5-12) to low (19-26) value. Then, participants receive motor movement training toward 8 high-value (4 fruit, 4 vegetable) and 8 low-value (4 fruit, 4 vegetable) items in response to an auditory cue. Item presentation (1 second) will be randomized within 8 blocks of 60 trials (~25% are cued items), including random jitter of 1.5 to 2.5 seconds between trials. Cue-presentation is delayed using a staircase procedure. In the first study, participants have to continually press a keyboard button, and are instructed to release it when they hear the cue. In the second study, participants will either do this reversed (identical to the original cue-approach paradigm), or will receive more detailed instructions on how to perceive their performed motor movements. Next, there will be a food-choice task in which participants get 1.5 seconds to choose between two same-category (fruit/vegetable), same-value items: one trained versus one untrained, for real consumption (32 unique pairs, presented four times across four blocks, with ~50% filler pairs, and random jitter of 1 to 2 seconds between trials). The experiment ends with a memory recall task, followed by a repetition of the first auction, after which participants are thanked, reimbursed and receive/buy their two pseudo-randomly selected fruits/vegetables.   \n\nMaterials\n \tPsychoPy. Study 2 will be entirely programmed and conducted using PsychoPy[6]. The scripts and stimuli that will be used in Study 2 are included in this pre-registration. It is important to note here that, although a detailed description of the procedure is given, the script is always leading. \n \tFruits and Vegetables. In total, 30 fruit and 30 vegetable stimuli will be used in Study 2. These are all photographed in front of a black background, featuring the respective food item in its unaltered form, with a slice or piece of it next to it. All pictures have a resolution of 3008x2000 pixels and are matched in height and width.  \n\nAnalyses\nTo test whether the respective type of training has an effect on food choice, first a repeated-measures logistic regression analysis will be performed on choices for go versus no-go stimuli. Next, we will also explore whether the effects will differ for high and low value items and for fruits and vegetables. To test the effects on WTP, a 2 (time: pre/post) x 2 (item value: high/low) x 2 (condition: trained/untrained) repeated-measures ANOVA will be performed. \n", "title": "Methodological Approach II"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/whpvf", "text": "Introduction\nIn an attempt to uncover the mechanisms underlying the cue-approach paradigm[1], we will investigate the effects of cue-approach training on food choice when the cue signals the release of a button instead of the press of a button. Thus, a functional mirror of the cue-approach paradigm will be performed, where the cued response is altered into an avoidance movement, which should convey a negative, instead of a positive motivational state.       \n\nOutcome Possibilities\nIn accordance with the above, there are three possible outcomes for this study that determine the further execution of a follow-up study. These are outlined below.\n\nOutcome Possibility 1\nCued items are valued lower and are chosen less often compared to un-cued items. This would suggest that the motivational quality of the performed response (avoidance) overrides the attentional salience for cued items. The next study will then aim to replicate effects found normally using the original cue-approach paradigm. \n\nOutcome Possibility 2\nCued items are both valued and chosen equally as compared to un-cued items. This would suggest that the motivational quality of the performed response and attentional salience for cued items balance each other out. The next study will then also aim to replicate effects found normally using the original cue-approach paradigm.\n\nOutcome Possibility 3\nCued items are valued higher and are chosen more often compared to un-cued items. This would suggest that the release of a button may not be construed as an avoidance movement. To be sure that the motivational quality of the response is processed as being negative in nature by the participants, the next study will then replicate this earlier study with additional instructions for participants on how to interpret the release of the button.\n", "title": "Research Topic II"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6ju8b", "text": "Note\n- These changes were made before starting data collection.\n\nParticipants\n- (Earlier) eating disorders are no longer used as an exclusion criteria.\n- Participants should not eat for three hours before the experiment commences (instead of four).\n\nProcedure &amp; Measures\n- Cued high-value items are ordered from 5-12 (instead of 4-11) and cued low-value items are ordered from 19-26 (instead of 20-27).\n- In the avoidance condition, presented food items are shrunk to 15% (instead of 50%).\n- The animation used for this takes 0.5 seconds (instead of 1).\n- In total, there are 32 unique pairs of items (instead of 64), which will be presented four times across four blocks (instead of twice across two blocks) in the binary choice task.\n- The jitter between item presentations averages at 1.5 seconds (instead of 2 seconds).\n", "title": "Improvements"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tw3u5", "text": "1.

Recruitment will take place via the Radboud Research Participation System and advertisements placed around the campus. Exclusion criteria are that participants should have no eating disorders or food restrictions/allergies, while earlier participation in similar studies is prohibited. Participants who bid less than \u20ac0.25 on auction items over 40 times will be excluded (see below). Furthermore, participants are asked not to consume any food items for at least four hours before the experiment commences[9,21,22]. Roughly 30 sessions will be conducted for a \u20ac10 reimbursement, while the remainder will be conducted for course credits. \n\nProcedure &amp; Measures\nIn both studies, participants are shown to a pantry where fruits and vegetables are stalled, receive \u20ac2, and are asked to give their informed consent. Then, they will practice and bid on 30 fruit and 30 vegetable items (one can be bought later) in a random-ordered Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction (which measures their Willingness To Pay: WTP, indicating subjective value[21,23]) using a slider that ranges from \u20ac0 to \u20ac2 (programmed using PsychoPy[24]). After this phase, all items are separated per category (fruit/vegetable) and are ordered from high (4-11) to low (20-27) value. Then, participants are randomized to receive either approach or avoidance motor movement training toward 8 high-value (4 fruit, 4 vegetable) and 8 low-value (4 fruit, 4 vegetable) items in response to an auditory cue. Item presentation (1 second) will be randomized within 8 blocks of 60 trials (~25% are cued items). Cue-presentation is delayed using a staircase procedure. In study 1, the motor movement will be a keyboard button press, while in study 2, participants have to perform a more realistic motor movement: \u2018swiping to self\u2019 (wrist flexion) for approach, and \u2018swiping away from self\u2019 (wrist extension) for avoidance (performed with the right hand[12,25]; Figure 1). After approach, the displayed item will be enlarged to 200%, whereas after avoidance, it will be shrunk to 50% (during a 1 second animation[13,15]). To further disambiguate the task, participants will be instructed to imagine moving the presented item toward or away from their body[16,26]. Next, there will be a food-choice task in which participants get 1.5 seconds to choose between two same-category (fruit/vegetable), same-value items: one trained versus one untrained, for real consumption (64 unique pairs, presented twice across 2 blocks, with ~50% filler pairs). The experiment ends with a repetition of the first auction, after which participants are thanked, reimbursed and receive/buy their two pseudo-randomly selected fruits/vegetables (Figure 2).   \n\nMaterials\nWithin the training phase of study 2, a Leap Motion[27] will track participants\u2019 finger and wrist movements, which verifies whether the correct motor movement has been performed. \n\nAnalyses\nTo test whether approach/avoidance training has an effect on food choice, four repeated-measures logistic regression analyses will separately be performed per condition with (1) item choice (trained/untrained) in the food-choice task as dependent variable, (2) with item value (high/low) and item category (fruit/vegetable) added as within-subject factors, (3) with the dataset split by item value (high/low), and (4) with the dataset split by item category (fruit/vegetable). To test the effects on WTP, a 2 (time: pre/post) x 2 (item value: high/low) x 2 (condition: trained/untrained) repeated-measures ANOVA will be performed per condition. Effect sizes will be compared exploratorily (using R[28,29]).", "title": "Methodological Approach"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tjvqa", "text": "Within the domain of eating regulation, it is an established idea that the food choices we make often happen without much deliberation. In terms of dual-process models, it is assumed that merely the perception of palatable foods can trigger impulsive eating behaviour via the associative network, which is not dependent upon cognitive resources or motivation[1-5]. This line of thinking has spawned multiple successful paradigms that aim to reduce people\u2019s impulses toward palatable (high value) food items by changing associations. For example, in evaluative conditioning, palatable food items\u2019 value can be decreased through repeated pairing with a negative stimulus[6], while in go/no-go and stop-signal paradigms, this is facilitated by contrasting palatable food items with a cue (e.g. auditory or pictorial) to which people should not respond, with other food items that have a cue to which should be responded[7-10] (e.g. by button press). \n\nNotably, a recent paradigm by Schonberg et al.[11], referred to as cued-approach, has shown the opposite. Instead of decreasing people\u2019s impulses toward palatable food items, this paradigm is argued to increase impulses toward food items in general (including low value, healthy food items), with effects lasting up to 4 months after singular training. In this paradigm, certain items are associated with a cue to which should be responded, while simultaneously, responses should be inhibited for items that are not associated with any cue. Due to this cue-pairing, increases in items\u2019 subjective value after training are attributed to greater attention (i.e. salience) toward those items. However, according to Schonberg et al.[11], the performed response\u2019s motor movements also play a yet unaccounted for, but important role in this theory, considering that sole observation of the training yields no effects. \n\nA possible explanation for these findings might be found within the approach-avoidance literature, where it is argued that \u2018approach\u2019 movements (toward an object or oneself) convey a positive motivational state, whereas \u2018avoidance\u2019 movements (away from an object or oneself) convey a negative motivational state, which can transfer to paired stimuli (also when disambiguated through visual feedback[12-16]). Considering the contrast that is made within the cued-approach paradigm between responding and not responding, while the response is framed as a movement toward an item (\u2018press a key when you see/hear a cue\u2019), it can be argued that responding here is essentially an equivalent of making an approach movement. Thus, it might not only be the attentional salience for cued-items that increases their subjective value, but also the inherent motivational quality of the associated response which people have to perform. \n\nThis poses the question whether cued-approach training functions through a similar modus operandi as approach training, rather than merely as an attention enhancer. In order to disentangle both explanations, it is worthwhile to examine the effects of employing avoidance movements within the cued-approach paradigm. If effects are driven by attention, one would expect increased evaluation of items irrespective of the type of movement. If effects are based on the motivational quality of the movement, avoidance should result in devaluation. This is relevant to explore, seeing that ideally a training paradigm would have the ability to decrease impulses toward palatable foods, whilst increasing impulses toward healthy foods. Especially in light of inconsistent findings for the approach-avoidance paradigm within the domain of eating regulation[17,18], while reliable effects have been attained in related domains (e.g. alcohol dependency[2,5,19]). \n\nIn accordance with the above, it is hypothesized that approach training within the cued-approach paradigm increases food items\u2019 subjective value. Effects of avoidance training are exploratorily investigated. The paradigm will be replicated across two studies, which vary in their representation of approach/avoidance movements.", "title": "Research Topic"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xhk9w", "text": "In order to reduce people\u2019s impulses toward palatable foods[30], multiple paradigms such as those of evaluative conditioning[6], go/no-go and stop-signal[7-10] have been developed and applied throughout the years. However, a recent paradigm, called cued-approach[11], has achieved success in an opposite manner: in increasing people\u2019s impulses toward healthy foods. The authors argue that the paradigm\u2019s positive effects are likely the result of increased attentional salience achieved through cue-pairing. Yet, they also underline the importance of performed motor movements in attaining effects, although they cannot theoretically account for them. In this research proposal the motivational quality of the response\u2019s motor movements is considered as a probable underlying mechanism, as within cued-approach, movements are framed similarly to approach movements from the approach-avoidance literature[12-16]. In order to disentangle both explanations, avoidance movements will be integrated within the cued-approach paradigm, so that attentional salience is directly pitted against the motivational quality of a response.

We obtained an effect size of d = .77 of cue-approach training on choices for go items versus no-go items using similar stimulus materials in a previous study in our lab. The sample size (25) is more than sufficient to detect an effect of the training on choices for go versus no-go items using a one-sample t-test according to a power analysis[3]. However, we will use a repeated-measures logistic regression as our main analysis instead of a t-test in line with previous work.

This will be framed in terms of them \u2018mimicking a natural reflex of humans to avoid rotten food\u2019, where the cue signifies that a food item is rotten.\n \tBinary-Choice Task. Next, there will be a food-choice task in which participants get 1.5 seconds to choose between two same-category (fruit/vegetable), same-value items: one trained versus one untrained, for real consumption (32 unique pairs, presented four times across four blocks, with ~50% filler pairs, and random jitter of 1 to 2 seconds between trials). It is important to note here that participants will be extensively instructed that none of the foods will be rotten, as only fresh versions of them will be handed out after the experiment.\n \tMemory Recall Task and Auction II. Afterwards, participants will perform a memory recall task in which they are asked to indicate for all 60 food items whether they were paired with the cue or not. This is followed by a repetition of the first auction. \n \tQuestions. The experiment concludes with questions that measure the extent to which participants viewed the cued response they performed as being avoidant and approaching, followed by an open-ended question that asks them to indicate what they thought it was that the cue represented during the training.\n\nMaterials\n \tPsychoPy. Study 3 will be entirely programmed and conducted using PsychoPy[6]. The scripts and stimuli that will be used are included in this pre-registration.

In total, 30 fruit and 30 vegetable (fresh) stimuli will be used in this study.

All pictures have a resolution of 3008x2000 pixels and are matched in height and width.  \n\nAnalyses\nTo test whether the training has an effect on food choice, first a repeated-measures logistic regression analysis will be performed on choices for go versus no-go stimuli. Next, we will also explore whether the effects will differ for high and low value items and for fruits and vegetables.

The pernicious effects of this broad societal trend are striking: Rising inequality is linked to poorer health and well-being across countries, continents, and cultures. The economic and psychological forces that perpetuate inequality continue to be studied, and in this theoretical review, we examine the role of daily experiences of economic inequality\u2014the often implicit communication of social class signals between interaction partners\u2014in this process. We theorize that social class signals activate social comparison processes that strengthen group boundaries between the haves and have-nots in society. In particular, we argue that class signals are a frequent, rapid, and accurate component of person perception, and we provide new data and analyses demonstrating the accuracy of class signaling in 60s interactions, Facebook photographs, and isolated recordings of brief speech. We suggest that barriers to the reduction of economic inequality in society arise directly from this class signaling process through the augmentation of class boundaries and the elicitation of beliefs and behaviors that favor the economic status quo.", "title": "Signs of Social Class:The Experience of Economic Inequality in Everyday Life"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/du2t4", "text": "", "title": "Hypotheses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hk8tr", "text": "", "title": "Measures"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/usw68", "text": "", "title": "Acceptance of affective computing environments \u2013 Study 1 influence of computer experience, computer self-efficacy and information"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/28dwe", "text": "", "title": "Hypotheses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ftv4a", "text": "", "title": "Planned Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d4kpb", "text": "", "title": "Development of the Creepiness of Situation Scale -

Yet, there is no systematic and commonly adopted approach within academic publishing for conducting replications in a robust, verifiable and transparent way. Also lacking is a positive incentive structure that rewards rigor over fishing exercises, in which a replicator is motivated to identify errors above all else. To inform the design of a future replication policy and pilot with the Journal of Development Engineering, this project will assess existing Journal post-publication replication models by hiring an independent replicator to conduct post-publication verifications (defined as executing the posted code on the posted data to verify that the tables can be accurately reproduced) on articles published in journals with existing open data for replication policies. We hypothesize that these post-publication verifications will reveal significant gaps in usability of data and low rates of success of post-publication verifications. Our prediction is that existing, passive research transparency policies and repositories are insufficient in ensuring the quality and usability of open source data and research materials. If we our correct, these findings will provide important evidence for the need for journals and the academic community more generally, to implement improved due diligence processes and incentives for ensuring the replicability and reliability of results.", "title": "Open Science &amp; Development Engineering: Evidence to Inform Improved Replication Models"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/98cjs", "text": "", "title": "Vision To Learn"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cgdmp", "text": "", "title": "proj_bertini"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/uy8x5", "text": "Pre-registration of hypotheses has been heralded as a promising solution to improve transparency in science.

Researchers who pre-register their study design and analysis strategy can profit from the immediate individual benefit of collecting data more efficiently by using sequential analyses and one-sided tests where useful and appropriate. This project consists of four work packages that explain to researchers what the benefits of sequential and/or one-sided designs can be in terms of efficiency, take away concerns about non-conventional designs by instigating a discussion about one-sided tests among researchers and statisticians, and asking whether editors of psychology journals will accept pre-registered sequential and/or one-sided analyses.

The discontinuous element behaves like an accent, i.e. a visual emphasis within the wholeness of components as shown in the next section. In this work, the accentuation principle has been extended to new visual domains. In particular, it is shown how this principle affects shape perception. Moreover several visual object attributes are also highlighted, among which orientation, spatial position, inner dynamics and apparent motion that determine the so-called organic segmentation and furthermore tend to induce figure-ground segregation. On the basis of the results of experimental phenomenology, the accentuation can be considered as a complex principle ruling grouping, figure-ground segregation, shape and meaning formation. Through a new musical illusion of downbeat, it is also demonstrated that this principle influences perceptual organization not only in space but also in time and, thus, in both visual and musical domains. This illusion can be heard in eight measures of Pagodes, a solo piano music by Claude Debussy (1862-1918), where a strong physical-perceptual discrepancy in terms of upbeats and downbeats inversion is strongly perceived in both staves.", "title": "The accentuation principle and the downbeat illusion"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/k2q5b", "text": "", "title": "Richard_et_al."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hxgbp", "text": "", "title": "Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o Power point"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/utsqm", "text": "", "title": "Dataset: Results of an attempt to reproduce the STAP phenomenon"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/s4ru6", "text": "", "title": "Ligeti"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vqmqb", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7q5n9", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/b6msc", "text": "", "title": "\u6570\u5b66\u610f\u6b32\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/angqh", "text": "", "title": "\u89aa\u5bc6\u306a\u95a2\u4fc2\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u66b4\u529b:\u5973\u5b50\u4e2d\u9ad8\u751f\u3092\u5bfe\u8c61\u3068\u3057\u3066"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kgsxn", "text": "In light of writing the introduction to my Masters by Research thesis, I have stated some hypotheses for the main experiment.

The number of discrete REMs over time, or REM density, has been investigated as a marker of clinical psychopathology and memory consolidation. However, human detection of REMs is a time-consuming and subjective process. Therefore, reliable, automated REM detection software is a valuable research tool.\nWe developed an automatic REM detection algorithm combining a novel set of extracted features and the 'AdaBoost' classification algorithm to detect the presence of REMs in Electrooculogram data collected from the right and left outer canthi (ROC/LOC). Algorithm performance measures of Recall (percentage of REMs detected) and Precision (percentage of REMs detected that are true REMs) were calculated and compared to the gold standard of human detection by three expert sleep scorers. REM detection by four non-experts were also investigated and compared to expert raters and the algorithm. \nThe algorithm performance (78.1% Recall, 82.6% Precision) surpassed that of the average (expert &amp; non-expert) single human detection performance (76% Recall, 83% Precision). Agreement between non-experts (Cronbach Alpha=0.65) is markedly lower than experts (Cronbach Alpha=0.80).\nBy following reported methods, we implemented all previously published LOC and ROC based detection algorithms on our dataset. Our algorithm performance exceeded all others.\nThe automatic detection algorithm presented is a viable and efficient method of REM detection as it reliably matches the performance of human scorers and outperforms all other known LOC- and ROC-based detection algorithms.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.11.015\nLink to publication: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027015004173", "title": "Automatic Detection of Rapid Eye Movements (REMs): A machine learning approach"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rju8m", "text": "", "title": "Jury Selection"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2p98a", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Kuziemko et al. 2014"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kvg4b", "text": "", "title": "Kogan et al. 2011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fnrh7", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Kirchler et al. 2012"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qve9x", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Kessler &amp; Roth 2012"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p2krz", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Ifcher &amp; Zarghamee 2011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gfeca", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Huck et al. 2011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4tvrs", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Fudenberg et al. 2012"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fauj7", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Friedman &amp; Oprea 2012"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/phknd", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Fehr et al. 2013"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vs65m", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Dulleck et al. 2011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/x2wcy", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Duffy &amp; Puzzello 2014"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bf3s9", "text": "", "title": "Replication of de Clippel et al. 2014"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/34qam", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Chen &amp; Chen 2011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kghtq", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Charness &amp; Dufwenberg 2011"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/whncv", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Bartling et al. 2012"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/y3azb", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Ambrus &amp; Greiner 2012"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xkqsb", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Abeler et al.

To the second question, \"What is the impact difference of first and later shots for 58 and 87 grain bullets with a 6mm hunting rifle?\"  The answer is that the lighter bullet moves right with repeated shots. The bullets also move up with that result being statistically significant. The heaver bullet moves left as the barrel heats up. The variance is smaller for the heaver weight bullet.

It includes the following information: subjective frequency ratings from 25-31 deaf signers, iconicity ratings from 21-37 hearing non-signers, videoclip duration, sign length (onset and offset), grammatical class, and whether the sign is initialized, a fingerspelled loan sign or a compound. Information about English translations is available for a subset of signs (e.g., alternate translations, translation consistency). In addition, phonological properties (sign type, selected fingers, flexion, major and minor location, and movement) were coded and used to generate sub-lexical frequency and neighborhood density estimates. ASL-LEX is intended for use by researchers, educators, and students who are interested in the properties of the American Sign Language lexicon. \n\nData aggregated over signs as well as trial level data are available for download from the \"Sign Data\" component in the \"Files\" section below. A key of terminology and a contact sheet with still images of all signs can also be located in the \"Sign Data\" section. An interactive website where the database can be browsed and downloaded is available at http://asl-lex.org, and a manuscript describing the database is available at http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0742-0.", "title": "ASL-LEX: A lexical database of American Sign Language"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ts5u6", "text": "", "title": "Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gnsti", "text": "", "title": "Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c8hb5", "text": "", "title": "Study 24: Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/q3e4u", "text": "", "title": "Study 20: Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bjrpc", "text": "", "title": "Study 19: Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/9jkpg", "text": "", "title": "Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sptzv", "text": "", "title": "Study 12: Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ge7us", "text": "", "title": "Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rfuj2", "text": "", "title": "Study 9: Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/a4e75", "text": "", "title": "Registered Report Additional Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rtn3f", "text": "", "title": "AdamGroup2"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6b7p8", "text": "Supplementary information for two articles on New Testament Satanology", "title": "Diabolical Data and Talk of the Devil"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4jhaq", "text": "", "title": "Raw data for PLOS ONE paper (Bedwell et al., 2016)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nye5r", "text": "", "title": "The Relative Influence of Juror Attitudes and Physical Evidence on Rape Trial Verdicts"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4jmwr", "text": "Pierce-Cloutier, M.

Pearce RepRaps (self Replicating Rapid prototypers), which 3-D print objects using fused filament fabrication (FFF) have evolved rapidly since their open source introduction. These 3-D printers have primarily been limited to desktop sizes of volumes of ~8 cubic cm, which has limited the attention of the scientific community to investigating deformation of common thermoplastics such as polylactic acid (PLA) used in FFF printing.  The only existing physically relevant deformation model was expanded to use a physics-based temperature gradient instead of a step function. This was necessary to generalize the model to 3-D printing in a room temperature environment without a heated chamber.  The thermal equation was calibrated using thermal measurements and validated by measuring curvature in printed objects. The results confirm that this is a valid model for predicting warpage of thin vertical walls of PLA. Additionally, the effect of annealing was examined. It was found that at a temperature of 50\u00b0C, no shrinkage or crystallization takes place, but at 90\u00b0C the rapidly crystallizes to around 20% crystallinity. This indicates that heated bed temperatures should be maintained at 50oC or lower to avoid print failure with PLA. At 90\u00b0C, the annealing is accompanied by a 5% size decrease in both horizontal dimensions, but an 8% increase in the vertical dimension. Thus, the volume decreased by only 3%, indicating potential methods of improving slicing of printing large PLA objects with FFF.", "title": "Improved Model and Experimental Validation of Deformation in Fused Filament Fabrication of Poly Lactic Acid"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/dcmbs", "text": "Whole body of a wild turkey; helical CT slices scanned at Royal Veterinary College, 120 kVp, 100 mA, 0.625 mm slice thickness, bone-optimized.

In Studies 2 and 3, lower-class individuals were more pro-social in a dictator game scenario in private than in public, whereas upper-class individuals showed the reverse pattern. Follow-up analyses revealed the importance of reputational concerns for shaping class differences in pro-sociality: Specifically, higher-class individuals reported that pride motivated their pro-social behavior more than lower-class individuals, and this association partially accounted for class-based differences in pro-sociality in public versus private contexts.

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is easy and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktop, bench, clean hood, chemical hood, cold room, glove box, incubator or biological hood.  Second, an on-board Arduino microcontroller powered via USB is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker mixer. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus these open source devices are technically superior to proprietary commercial equipment and can save over 90% of the costs.", "title": "Open Source Laboratory Sample Rotator Mixer and Shaker"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p2var", "text": "", "title": "Supplementary Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7a9y5", "text": "Contains data and STATA analysis scripts for Tannenbaum et al.

The study, funded by the Administration for Children and Families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the first rigorous evaluation of career pathways strategies nationwide. PACE utilizes an experimental study design to assess the impact of the nine programs on educational attainment, employment and earnings, and other outcomes. Eligible applicants at each of the nine programs are assigned at random to either a treatment group that can access program services or a control group that cannot, but that can access other services in the community. Random assignment ensures that the characteristics of the two groups have no systematic differences at baseline and thus makes it possible to estimate impacts without bias by comparing average outcomes for treatment and control group members over time. PACE includes an implementation study that will describe and document the design and operations of each of the nine PACE programs. The implementation study also provides contextual information for understanding and interpreting the impact estimates and findings on implementation experiences can guide future program designs and implementations. The impact study will measure differences between the treatment and control group members on educational outcomes (e.g., persistence in education, receipt of certificates and degrees) and employment- and earnings-related outcomes. The PACE team will analyze and report findings for each program separately. The rationale for separate studies is that, although all nine programs utilize basic building blocks in career pathways, they vary on a substantial number of fundamental design features, including eligibility criteria and target populations; services provided; goals for participants; and timeframes for expecting goals to be achieved. The PACE impact reports will cover 15 months of follow-up after the point of random assignment.", "title": "Pathways for Advancing Careers and Education (PACE)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hu23a", "text": "", "title": "ZEN 2011 data prep files and scripts"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vq8fe", "text": "NDS App for interfacing with containers", "title": "NDS"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zur8m", "text": "Code, data, and supplementary material for invited chapter \"Bayesian methods in cognitive modeling\" for the forthcoming \"The Stevens\u2019 Handbook of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, Fourth Edition\"", "title": "Bayesian methods in cognitive modeling"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/s5w4m", "text": "Tutorials for datalab.cc", "title": "datalab.cc"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p6dae", "text": "an existential journey into the center of time", "title": "Ted Ted Ted Project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t8567", "text": "", "title": "Status Summary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4v7kz", "text": "", "title": "Reproducibility of Execution Environments in Scientific Workflows using Semantics and Containers"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/w4bth", "text": "", "title": "Design Procedures"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pzqmh", "text": "", "title": "Software System"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zyk9f", "text": "", "title": "Ian Taylor: Researcher Dashboard"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6f49a", "text": "", "title": "Rafael Ferreira da Silva: Pegasus"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fs93m", "text": "Open data and materials for the study \"Reconsidering Temporal Selection in the Attentional Blink\" by Goodbourn, et al.", "title": "Reconsidering Temporal Selection in the Attentional Blink"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4avh5", "text": "", "title": "Presentations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3y67j", "text": "", "title": "Program"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7rgxa", "text": "", "title": "Conference photos"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/z2yh5", "text": "The University of California Personality Conference (UCPC) is a bi-annual conference designed to bring together faculty and graduate students across the UC system to discuss and present topics relating to personality psychology.", "title": "UCPC 2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/86wze", "text": "", "title": "Paltering Study 4B"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3uwp5", "text": "", "title": "Meeting Notes 2015-2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t4hnu", "text": "", "title": "Examples of Collaborations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nemc6", "text": "Datasets associated with the paper presenting the CHiCAGO pipeline (Cairns*/Freire-Pritchett* et al., 2016)", "title": "Analysis of Promoter Capture Hi-C data for GM12878 and mouse ES cells using the CHiCAGO pipeline"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2qces", "text": "Time series analyses of being moved and correlates", "title": "Continuously moved"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zq2wx", "text": "Multiple inventories claiming to assess the same explicit motive (achievement, power, or affiliation) show only mediocre convergent validity.

We quantified general startle reactivity in the Resting State Task as the mean raw startle response during the task. For these three tasks, two measures, and two quantification methods we evaluated effect size robustness and stability, internal consistency (i.e., split-half reliability), and one-week temporal stability. The psychometric properties of startle potentiation in the NPU task were good but concerns were noted for corrugator potentiation in this task. Some concerns also were noted for the psychometric properties of both startle and corrugator modulation in the Affective Picture Viewing task, in particular for pleasant picture modulation.

WM capacity is reduced in old age, but the nature of this decline is yet not clear. The current study examined the hypothesis that the decline in visual WM performance with age is related to a reduced ability to use attention to control the contents of WM. Young (M = 26 years) and old (M = 71 years) adults performed a color reproduction task in which the precise color of a set of dots had to be maintained in mind over a brief interval and later reproduced using a continuous color wheel. Attention was manipulated by presenting a spatial cue before the onset of the memory array (a pre-cue) or during the maintenance phase (retro-cue). The cue indicated with 100% certainty the item to-be tested at the end of the trial. A pre-cue allows the selective encoding of only the relevant item to WM, whereas a retro-cue allows WM contents to be updated by refreshing the relevant (cued) item and removing non-relevant (non-cued) items. Aging was associated with a lower capacity in the baseline (No-Cue) condition. Pre-cues and (to a smaller extent) retro-cues improved WM performance (in terms of probability of recall and memory precision). Critically, the benefits of cueing were of similar magnitude in young and older adults showing that the ability to use attention to selectively encode and update the contents of WM is preserved with aging.

Although research has made strides in better defining suicidal behaviors, there has been less focus on accurate measurement. Currently, the widespread use of self-report, single-item questions to assess suicide ideation, plans and attempts may contribute to measurement problems and misclassification. We examined the validity of single-item measurement and the potential for statistical errors. Over 1,500 participants completed an online survey containing single-item questions regarding a history of suicidal behaviors, followed by questions with more precise language, multiple response options and narrative responses to examine the validity of single-item questions. We also conducted simulations to test whether common statistical tests are robust against the degree of misclassification produced by the use of single-items. We found that 11.3% of participants that endorsed a single-item measure of suicide attempt, engaged in behavior that would not meet the standard definition of a suicide attempt. Similarly, 8.8% of those who endorsed a single-item measure of suicide ideation endorsed thoughts that would not meet standard definitions of suicide ideation. Statistical simulations revealed that this level of misclassification substantially decreases statistical power and increases the likelihood of statistical decision errors. Providing a wider range of response options for each item reduced the misclassification rate by approximately half.  The use of single-item, self-report questions to assess the presence of suicidal behaviors leads to a substantial amount of misclassification and increases the likelihood of statistical decision errors. Improving the measurement of suicidal behaviors is critical to increase understanding and prevention of suicide.", "title": "Single-Item Measurement of Suicidal Behaviors:  Validity and Consequences of Misclassification"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xksqw", "text": "", "title": "Library of cloud pictures"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5hw69", "text": "A collection of openly shared data from my PhD dissertation research (mostly published elsewhere in various articles).", "title": "Changing Climate Attitudes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mnvw6", "text": "Open Source Deep Learning Network", "title": "digidesk.io"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6uwvj", "text": "Presented are series of assignments for SPSS 22, which allows for students to learn the basics of opening data files to the complexities of creating a professional conference poster.

Research has demonstrated that there are two types of accuracy (West &amp; Kenny, 2011). One form of accuracy (tracking accuracy) involves correctly detecting behavior patterns or traits when making judgments (e.g., Claire may know that John is intelligent), whereas the other form of accuracy (directional bias) involves overestimation or underestimation of these behavior patterns or traits when making judgments (e.g., Claire may think John is more intelligent than he actually is). One domain of relationships that has downstream effects on other relationship processes (e.g., satisfaction) is sexual communication. Miscommunication and misperceptions of sexual desires are common in romantic contexts (e.g. Muise, Stanton, Kim, &amp; Impett, under review; Simms &amp; Byers, 2009). However, the possible interplay between bias and accuracy in perceptions of partners' sexual advance behaviours and their capacity to influence romantic relationship outcomes has yet to be investigated systematically. The current study will address this gap in the literature, and also examine how adult attachment styles may moderate the effects of accuracy and bias on relationship outcomes. *Note that at the time of registration, data collection was in progress.

The present research aimed to test the effect of carrying a heavy (or light) clipboard on the perceived importance of helping and on the judged severity of moral transgressions. After finding no significant effects in two experiments, a third study explored whether the absence of a significant effect was due to (1) insensitivity of the morality-related measurements to accessibility effects or to (2) the concept of importance not being grounded in sensations of weight. Specifically, Study 3 was an attempt to replicate two studies previously reported in the literature.

As part of this broader approach, researchers are looking to explore the range of threat compensation (i.e., dissonance reduction) strategies that people employ in more authentic social situations. Motivated by previous work on goal pursuit (e.g., Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998; see Jonas, et al., 2014) deception (e.g., DePaulo, 2004; DePaulo et al., 2003) and self-presentation (e.g., Schlenker, 2012), we will seek to determine if a form of strategic self-presentation called \"pro-social lying\" (i.e., deceptive behavior intended to bolster or maintain social relationships) can act as a threat compensation strategy.\n\nWe will put people under threat by having them read a high-quality belief-threatening essay; we will then measure their negative affect, interactions with another person, and attitudes regarding the essay\u2019s author. By manipulating combinations of these factors we hope to determine the viability of strategic self-presentation as a threat-compensation strategy, and by way of this specific question, also reveal the broader psychological processes at work in these situations.\n\nThis study is laboratory based and uses undergraduate students as subjects. Participants are compensated with course credit. In this study, participants are provided with two different opportunities to compensate for belief threat: (1) they are given the opportunity to evaluate the essay that threatened their beliefs and its author and (2) they are given an opportunity to interact with a person in a mildly tense social situation in which many responses are possible.\n\nData collection for this study began in late August, 2015.", "title": "Can self-presentation serve as fluid compensation for psychological threat?

Since early 17th Century, TIPs had been playing a crucial role during the Great Marine Times of East Asia trades. There was a rich body of ethnographic, official and academic records on TIPs before 1940. However,  the period of 1940-2000 marks as data \u201dDark Ages\u201d for TIPs due to 1941-45 Pacific War,  1946-1990 political authoritarian rule in fears of communism and communists infiltration. Persistent lack of TIPs data led TIPs to become isolated, marginalized and thus underdeveloped. Taiwan resumed TIPs population census in 2000 and began recording TIPs individual records in household registration system since 2003. This research program is conducted on the basis of a four-year Joint Research Agreement between Academia Sinica and Council of Indigenous Peoples starting in 2013. One important aim of the research is to construct big anonymous TIPs open research data (or TIPD) based on contemporary census and household registration data sets. TIPD utilizes state-of-the-art data science, record linkage, geocoding, and high-performance in-memory computing technology to construct various dimensions of TIPs demographics &amp; developments. Major outputs of TIPD applications include cross-sectional categorical data, longitudinally constructed population dynamics data, life tables, household statistics, micro genealogy data, intra- &amp; inter-ethnic marriage data, ethnic integration data, ethnic patriarchy and matriarchy identity data, etc. They reflect the progress and efforts of Taiwan academicians struggling to construct various developments of contemporary TIPs. Not only is the research program expected to unveil contemporary TIPs demographics and various developments, but also to help overcome research barriers &amp; unleash social creativity for TIPs studies. They will contribute to shed lights on contemporary population, human dynamics, and developments of TIPs which have been \u201cinvisible\u201d to the world for seven decades.\n\n2 Types of TIPD: Major outputs of TIPD which are open to the public amount to 7,300 files in number and around 32 GB in size. TIPD are bilingually documented and its content, context, and volume are growing steadily. TIPD now consist of three categories of open research data: (1) categorical data, (2) household structure and characteristics data, and (3) population dynamics data. Categorical data include two broad dimensions. The first one is contingency tables which are available in PDF, HTML, RTF, XLS formats, while the other is multi-dimensional data which are offered in CSV, Excel, dBase, Access, Matlab, Gauss, HTML, JMP, SAS, SPSS, Stata, &amp; Access formats. Household structure and characteristics data consist of three broad dimensions of information: (1) household head information, (2) household member composition information, and (3) household geographical information. They are also available in CSV, Excel, dBase, Access, Matlab, Gauss, HTML, JMP, SAS, SPSS, Stata, &amp; Access formats. Population dynamics data consists of three categories: (1) increased population within a given period of time. It can be further dichotomized into two branches of data, population increase due to birth and due to immigration; (2) decreased population within a given period of time. It can also be divided into two branches of data, population decrease due to death and due to emigration; (3) intact population within a given period of time. It can be distinguished into two categories of population: those who make internal migration and those remaining staying-put. For intact population who make internal migration, internal migration processes such as in-, out-, net, gross migrations are analyzable. Every types of population dynamics data are available in CSV, Excel, dBase, Access, Matlab, Gauss, HTML, JMP, SAS, SPSS, Stata, &amp; Access formats. The potential applications for research on TIPs based on TIPD include studies on birth, death, migration, residential mobility, life table, marriage, ageing, education, medical care, labor, family, community, etc. TIPD could be used as background data for survey study, including population analysis, sampling design and sampling planning. \n\n3.  Potential contributions:  TIPD potential contributions are threefold. First, theoretically based on data science, not only does TIPD overcome legal and ethical issues, but it also democratizes the use of detailed information hidden in modern micro data sets. Thus it is expected to promote research and unleash creativity in the context of TIPs studies and to enhance the visibility of TIPs.

In orthographies where sublexical correspondences are complex, inconsistent, and/or incomplete, the decoding process is more difficult and therefore slower. This results in more time for the lexical route to retrieve the relevant information, and a greater relative ratio of lexical processing. Although evidence for this claim exists (Frost et al., 1987; Frost, 1994), it is unclear whether complexity, inconsistency, and incompleteness affect reading processes in the same way. Here, we test the evidence for this mechanism for words with inconsistent (in English) and complex (in French) correspondences. In a reading aloud task, we find stronger involvement of lexical processing, as measured by the frequency effect, for inconsistent compared to consistent words, as well as for complex compared to simple words. The results confirm that Katz and Frost\u2019s proposed mechanism applies to different sources of orthographic depth.", "title": "Unpredictability and complexity of print-to-speech correspondences increase reliance on lexical processes: More evidence for the Orthographic Depth Hypothesis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xzd5t", "text": "", "title": "To get started"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/54h9z", "text": "This registration makes public the data and materials necessary to reproduce the results and procedures of the study Rogers, T. and Milkman, K.

The seminal example is the potential collision of a looming object with one\u2019s body. However, humans are also capable of identifying with entities outside one\u2019s own body. Here we report evidence that behavioral urgency transfers to an avatar in a simple 2-D computer game. By controlling the avatar, the participant responded to shape changes of the target in a visual search task. Simultaneously, and completely irrelevant to the task, one of the objects on screen could move. Responses were overall fastest when the target happened to be the moving object and was on a collision course with the avatar, as compared to when the moving target just passed by the avatar or moved away from it. The effects on search efficiency were less consistent, except that search was more efficient overall whenever a target moved. Moreover, response speeding was frequently accompanied by an increase in errors, consistent with recent evidence that the urgency of looming is at least to a large extent expressed in response processes rather than in perceptual selection of the looming object. Thus, a general version of the behavioral-urgency hypothesis also holds for external entities with which the observer can identify.\n\nCitation: \nSchreij, D. &amp; Olivers, C.N.L.

be dissociated into two parts: its strength, the proportion of pieces of information favoring one hypothesis; and its weight, the total number of pieces of information available. However, cognitive and neural models of evidence accumulation often make a proportional representation assumption, implying that people take these two factors into account equally when making their decisions and judgments. We examine this assumption by directly manipulating the number of samples and the proportion favoring either of two alternatives in dynamic decision making and judgment tasks. The results suggest that people tend to over-emphasize the strength of evidence relative to its weight in both an optional-stopping decision task and a probability judgment task. In a drift-diffusion model, this is reflected by drift rates that are determined foremost by strength with a smaller influence of weight. This result challenges the proportional representation assumption made by existing models of judgment and decision-making, and calls into question modeling evidence accumulation as a Bayesian belief updating process.", "title": "Strength and weight: The determinants of choice and confidence"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/z4jrs", "text": "Grand Challenges Africa Community Meeting held in Nairobi, Kenya from February 21-26, 2016", "title": "HBGDki - Africa Collaboration Meeting 2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jasu8", "text": "This study will use a single case AB design to explore which aspects of an individual case formulation predict treatment outcomes in individuals receiving PTSD treatment who have co-morbid cannabis or alcohol use.

Recent researchers used different finite element models to describe the behavior of soil under dynamic compaction; those models varied between 1-D simple model and up to 3-D sophisticated ones. The aim of this research is to introduce a simple mathematical approach to simulate ground deformations and soil parameters improvement due to dynamic compaction. The proposed approach consists of two equations, the 1st one used to calculate the ground settlement due to one temper drop, the 2nd one used to calculate the updated soil parameters due to the ground settlement from the previous drop. By applying the two equations successively, both ground settlement and soil parameters improvement could be calculated after each tamper drop. The proposed approach was applied on four case studies and its results were so close to measured ones.

Unfortunately, those sophisticated models are too complicated to be used in practical design. Hence, the aim of this research is to introduce a much simpler and practical approach to predict the behavior of the laterally loaded concrete piles considering the nonlinear effect of concrete cracking. Special calculating tool based on finite elements is developed to carry out a parametric study of the behavior of a set of 24 piles with different aspect ratios, reinforcement ratios, relative stiffness and head constrains. The validity of the calculating tool is checked against case history field tests. The results of the parametric study show three different failure modes according to the flexibility of the pile.

In fact, better communication is the key to lowering health care costs and improving patient experience. Nevertheless, communication is a two-way street in healthcare. Particularly, when it comes to those who suffer from critical, severe and life-threatening conditions, establishing a strong culture of compassion improves quality of care. Hence, taking a humanistic approach by sustaining empathy and compassion is critical for such patients.\n\nPlan: The project\u2019s main objective is to improve communication and relationships between physicians and patients.

Formal methods for scholarly communication are undergoing vast transformation owing to the open-access movement and reproducible research. However, informal scholarly communication that takes place at professional society meetings and conferences has received limited research attention relying primarily on serendipitous interaction. With the support of the Sloan Foundation, this project aims to fundamentally improve informal methods of scholarly communication by leveraging their serendipitous interaction and informing researchers how they can self-organize themselves, making them more aware of co-located people with mutual interests.   \n\nObjectives: Geoscientists increasingly need interdisciplinary teams to solve their research problems. Currently, geoscientists use Research Networking (RN) systems to connect with each other and find people of similar and dissimilar interests. Our objective is to help them improve their network connections by tracking research interests at their professional society meetings using RFID data, and recommending to them other co-located people of potential interest. We will use Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) meetings, which are held over a period of 3-4 days in parallel sessions, as a testbed to track and make network recommendations.  \n\nProposed Activities:  This project has four activities: (1) Acquisition of current interests through RFID tags and sensors;  (2) Correlation of current interests with past interests through user-profile linkage, and (3) Development of a  recommendation system that will inform in real-time how researchers can  connect with each other through ResearchBit mobile application, and (4) Dissemination of results  and analysis.  This project will enhance our understanding of informal methods of scholarly communication: how does researcher interest flow during a meeting, whom do they interact with, and how can meetings be better organized. They will inform how Research Networking systems can use current interests of researchers to enhance user profiles and incentivize researchers to update them. The project can inform how large-scale geoscience networking events such as the American Geophysical Union, consisting of more than 10,000 attendees are made more self-organizing.\n\nSee the wiki below for more information and for project updates and current status.\n\n.", "title": "ResearchBit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mfcxd", "text": "", "title": "Dunn, T.

The recent dramatic reduction in R&amp;D by the pharmaceutical industry for novel medications to treat psychiatric conditions, particularly substance use disorders, provides a strong impetus to \u201crepurpose\u201d currently available compounds that may be effective treatment alternatives. Orally available, brain-penetrant alpha1-noradrenergic (NE) receptor antagonists are widely used to treat hypertension. Additionally, alpha1-NE antagonists are increasingly used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), consistent with the well-documented role of NE in mediating multiple behavioral and physiological processes in stress. Stress is a significant contributor to alcohol/drug relapse. Stress-related reinstatement is a well-validated animal model of addiction and alpha1-NE antagonists reduce relapse in this animal model. NIAAA Director George Koob has made strong calls for translational research on stress-mechanisms in humans. This preclinical evidence in animals suggests the use of alpha1-NE antagonists may be useful in relapse prevention including stress-related relapse. To test this hypothesis, we propose two complementary preclinical and clinical objectives in humans:\n1. To translate the preclinical evidence from animal models to stress-induced relapse in humans via direct pharmacological antagonism of the NE system in abstinent alcoholics with doxazosin, an alpha1-NE blocker.\n2. To screen the efficacy of doxazosin to target stress-related relapse mechanisms in abstinent alcoholics as a cost-effective first step to repurpose this alpha1-NE antagonist for relapse prevention in addiction.\n\nThese two objectives will be accomplished in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of recently abstinent alcoholics, to examine the efficacy of 8 mg doxazosin (vs. placebo, between-subjects) during an 8 week treatment period on stress reactivity using a well-validated human model of stressor reactivity (NPU task). The NPU task has strong translational ties to both methods and measures from the preclinical literature in animals. This task has demonstrated reliable, robust effects of drug administration and drug deprivation in drug dependent users. As such, it serves as an attractive early surrogate endpoint to assess treatment efficacy and examine stress mechanisms during the treatment period.  Important clinical outcomes (e.g., point prevalence and continuous abstinence, days drinking, craving, perceived stress) are also measured during treatment. Repurposing existing pharmaceutical agents has recently been promoted by NIH director, Francis Collins, as a research priority. Tom Insel and others have strongly advocated for the development and use of early surrogate endpoints in clinical research. This project aligns well with the NIMH RDoC focus on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures in psychopathology research and the simultaneous examination of mechanism and outcome in RCTs.\n\n\nPublic Health Relevance: \nEighteen million people in the United States suffer from an alcohol use disorder and current pharmacotherapy treatment for alcoholism yields relatively low probability of a patient successfully attaining long-term recovery.

The second objective is to determine whether prazosin, an FDA-approved blood pressure medication, is effective at reducing stress-reactivity among abstinent alcoholics who are trying to quit drinking. No currently available pharmacotherapy treatment options for alcoholism are specifically designed to prevent relapse caused by stress, which is a common hurdle in the way of attaining long-term recovery. As the pharmaceutical industry has drastically reduced its investment in developing novel medications to treat alcoholism in recent years, it is becoming increasingly essential to identify currently available drugs with known neurobiological mechanisms, such as prazosin, that may be effective treatment alternatives for addiction.\n\nThe current study aims to evaluate the effects of prazosin on stress-reactivity in alcoholics in early abstinence versus healthy volunteers. Participants will take either prazosin or a placebo pill at two laboratory sessions, after which they will complete a stress task. The task will consist of three conditions exposing participants to unpredictable shock, predictable shock, or no shock. The eye blink startle response will be measured as a physiological index of the participants\u2019 reactivity to the stressful task (i.e., predictable and unpredictable shocks). Previous research has consistently demonstrated that drugs that reduce the stress response, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines, reduce the startle response specifically to unpredictable stressors. Furthermore, drug deprivation among drug dependent individuals (e.g., nicotine, marijuana or alcohol) selectively increases the startle response during unpredictable stressors. This is an attractive lab task as very similar methods (e.g. unpredictable shock) and measures (e.g., startle) have been used extensively in rodents and non-human primates, so the field has a rich understanding of the neurobiology involved in this stress system. In particular, the neurotransmitter norepinephrine has been critically implicated in the stress response, and prazosin, a drug that blocks norepinephrine alpha1 receptors, has been shown to reduce stress-induced relapse in rodent models of alcoholism. This study will examine whether prazosin reduces the startle response during unpredictable stressors in abstinent alcoholics in early recovery vs. healthy volunteers. These findings would suggest that norepinephrine alpha1 receptors are involved in stress-reactivity in humans and that prazosin may be an effective treatment of stress-induced relapse for alcoholics pursuing abstinence.\n\nGiven the tremendous cost associated with conducting large scale clinical trials to vet treatments for addiction, the current proposal represents an efficient laboratory-based screening procedure to evaluate the potential efficacy of novel pharmacotherapies. This type of translational research aims to expand treatment options for the eighteen million people in the United States who suffer from an alcohol use disorder.\n\nPublic Health Relevance:\nEighteen million people in the United States suffer from an alcohol use disorder and current pharmacotherapy treatment for alcoholism yields relatively low probability of a patient successfully attaining long-term recovery.

Cognitive models of judgment such as Range Frequency Theory predict in contrast that the entire payment distribution will influence evaluation of each individual payment. Two experiments examined satisfaction with a series of payments. In both experiments, most payments were either relatively high in the experienced distribution (the distribution was negatively skewed) or relatively low (positively skewed). The total and average payment was held constant. Experiment 1 found that average satisfaction with individual payments was higher when the payments were negatively skewed, consistent with Range Frequency Theory and earlier findings were extended by comparing Range Frequency Theory with a range-based model, a rank-based model, and a reference point model at the individual level. Experiment 2 examined satisfaction with whole sequences of payments and found that receiving a negatively skewed sequence was more satisfying overall than receiving a positively skewed sequence.

Things such as land, can be physically located in a particular place. The basic structure of property law is based on concepts that apply throughout the property law system. Some parts of the property law system also have their own separate rules. Because of many reasons, land is one such special thing. As a result, the land law system rests on the same basic structure of the property law system. Thus it forms a different part of that system. \nIn the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property roughly corresponds to personal property, while immovable property corresponds to real estate or real property, and the associated rights and obligations thereon. A property lawyer\u2019s primary focus is real estate transactions which apply to the preparation and review of documents, title transfer and also negotiation of terms and conditions. These lawyers may be called upon by companies who are unsure of real estate laws and regulations. They are in need to know how property law could affect their business while buying or selling properties. When a breach of contract or a real estate fraud occurs, property lawyers go to court to represent their client in the case. The work hours can be long as they serve the various needs of their clients.\nIn addition to analytical, verbal communication or written skills, there is an emphasis to develop strong negotiating skills. Time management and organizational skills are very essential because a lawyer in this field will have to handle multiple cases and documents at any given time.

Safety signals can reduce fear to threat, but precise mechanisms remain unclear. Safety signals may acquire attentional salience and affective properties (e.g., relief) independent of the threat; alternatively, safety signals may only hold affective value in the presence of simultaneous threat. To clarify such mechanisms, an experimental paradigm assessed independent processing of threat and safety cues.\n\nParticipants viewed a series of red and green words from two semantic categories. Shocks were administered following red words (Cue+). No shocks followed green words (Cue-). Words from one category were defined as Safety Signals; no shocks were administered on Cue+ trials. Words from the other (control) category did not provide information regarding shock administration. Threat (Cue+ vs. Cue-) and Safety (SS+ vs. SS-) were fully crossed. Startle response and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded.\n\nStartle response was increased during Cue+ vs. Cue-.  Safety signals reduced startle response during Cue+, but had no effect on startle response during Cue-. ERP analyses (PD130 and P3) suggested that participants parsed threat and safety signal information in parallel. Motivated attention was not associated with safety signals in the absence of threat. Overall, these results confirm that fear can be reduced by safety signals. Furthermore, safety signals do not appear to hold inherent hedonic salience independent of their effect during threat. Instead, safety signals appear to enable participants to engage in effective top-down emotion regulatory processes.\n", "title": "Emotion regulation during threat: Parsing the time course and consequences of safety signal processing"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/z7ptv", "text": "", "title": "Relationships between Moral Foundations and political orientation \u2013 local study and meta-analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/86e9f", "text": "A response to Wagenmakers, Morey &amp; Lee's analysis of the South Park Hypothesis regarding Adam Sandler movies.", "title": "RE: Bayesian Benefits for the Pragmatic Researcher"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gebk6", "text": "", "title": "Results"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qvuf6", "text": "", "title": "Hypothesis for Replication"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6a7sx", "text": "A longitudinal study of law graduates' experience awaiting their result on the bar exam, with a randomized intervention (training in mindfulness meditation vs. loving-kindness meditation).", "title": "The effect of meditation on the experience of awaiting uncertain news"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8yeb6", "text": "Data and code used in Goldschmidt, Manoonpong, Dasgupta, 2016 (submitted)", "title": "Neural Mechanisms for Reward-Modulated Vector Learning and Navigation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6937j", "text": "Materials to be released upon acceptance.", "title": "Perceived Stress and Telomere Length (Mathur et al. 2016)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3t6rm", "text": "", "title": "Worldwide Influenza A (H5N1) Human Cases (Patel et al. 2014; Mathur et al. 2014)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/r8m73", "text": "\u53f0\u5357\u5e02\u65b0\u5316\u5340\u7901\u5751\u91cc\u6587\u5316\u8cc7\u7522\u8abf\u67e5", "title": "\u7901\u5751\u6587\u5316\u8cc7\u7522\u8abf\u67e5"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/n62wk", "text": "It as been well documented that misinterpretation through texting and other mean of digital services lead to miscommunication.

Nonetheless, scientific efforts to clarify the risk for addiction and other harm associated with marijuana use have been lacking. Maladaptive decision-making is a cardinal feature of addiction that is likely to emerge in heavy users. In particular, distorted subjective reward valuation related to homeostatic or allostatic processes has been implicated for many drugs of abuse. Selective changes in responses to uncertainty have been observed in response to intoxication and deprivation from various drugs of abuse. To assess for these potential neuroadaptive changes in reward valuation associated with marijuana deprivation, we examined the subjective value of uncertain and certain rewards among deprived and non-deprived heavy marijuana users in a behavioral economics decision-making task. Deprived users displayed reduced valuation of uncertain rewards, particularly when these rewards were more objectively valuable. This uncertainty aversion increased with increasing quantity of marijuana use.  These results suggest comparable decision-making vulnerability from marijuana use as other drugs of abuse, and highlights targets for intervention.", "title": "Altered subjective reward valuation among drug-deprived heavy marijuana users: Aversion to uncertainty (Data and study materials)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pzvxu", "text": "This is the research program of Dr. Robert S.

In this view, dishonesty is facilitated by justifications that redefine moral boundaries. By contrast, the Bounded Ethicality approach suggests that biased perception prevents people from becoming aware of their dishonesty. We tested the key process assumptions behind these accounts using pupillary responses and fixation data and found physiological evidence for both kinds of mechanisms. Specifically, physiological arousal increased in cheating responses, but was attenuated by the level of ethical dissonance, suggesting that people are somewhat aware of their wrongdoings. At the same time, we found attentional biases that reduced the likelihood for detecting potentially disadvantageous information. We conclude that dishonest acts come at the internal cost of increased tension, which people aim to avoid by preemptive biased processing as well as post-hoc justifications. \n\n***http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.1932/abstract***", "title": "\"I can see it in your eyes\": Biased processing and increased arousal in dishonest responses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ye6pq", "text": "", "title": "Paper"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zcw6y", "text": "", "title": "Budget Framing"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c2ehn", "text": "", "title": "Education and lower prejudice four merged samples (Study 2)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3d8qa", "text": "Persuasive video games are video games for which the primary goal is to persuade the player of a certain point of view or to influence the player\u2019s behaviour in the real \u2013 non-game - world.

In addition, more insight is needed with regards to the how these games work. Therefore, the present research investigated the effectiveness of a persuasive game, but also tested the mediating influence of role taking, immersion, and narrative transportation. Two studies (NStudy 1 = 134; NStudy 2 = 94) investigated whether AAO resulted in more positive attitudes, increased willingness to help. Participants were randomized into an experimental condition, in which they played a single session of AAO, or into a control condition, in which participants read a newspaper article about refugees, viewed a television programme about refugee (both Study 1), read a written account of the events in the video game (Study 2), of were not exposed to any media content about refugees (both studies). Role taking, immersion, and narrative transportation were investigated as potential mediators of the persuasive game effects. The results showed that the persuasive game did not result in significantly more positive attitudes and stronger willingness to help, relative to a no-treatment control condition. Moreover, video resulted in more immersion, more narrative transportation (both Study 1), and more positive attitudes, while text resulted in more immersion (Study 1 and 2). In sum, the present study yielded no evidence that persuasive video games can be effective.

This effect causes people who are affected by the censorship to change their attitudes towards the censored standpoint \u2013 a process attributed to psychological reactance. Censorship induced reactance has been thoroughly examined by scholars for decades, but its effects on actual political behavior has received very little attention. Considering the current political discourse in Sweden, immigration policies are at the focal point. While Anti-immigration attitudes are consistently banned and ostracized in many public schools, work places and media \u2013  the only Anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, is steadily gaining support in opinion polls. The aim of this study is to investigate if psychological reactance can be a contributing factor to the rise of support for the Sweden Democrats. By assessing an experimental paradigm used in previous research, a censorship will be applied on messages from the party, in order to evoke reactance. Participants' attitudes will be measured before and after being exposed to this censorship in order to assess any attitudinal effects caused by reactance. It is to be expected that the participants in the experimental group display a larger support for the Sweden Democrats after the manipulation, than the participants in the control group that was not subject to any censorship.

First, it examined how one\u2019s low regard for future reward can influence one\u2019s time-bound decision making also known as temporal decision making. Second, it examined how the control (i.e. emotion regulation) of negative emotion also influenced temporal discounting. The study hypothesizes that 1) low anticipatory wanting and 2) employing suppression and reappraisal predict discounting behavior. TEPS was used to measure anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia whereas the emotion regulation task and delay discounting task were adapted from previous experimental studies and appropriately designed using Superlab 5. The data were collected from participants composed of 206 and was analyzed using process macro SPSS version 21. The results failed to show that the proposed predictors were directly associated with discounting. The author resolved to conditional indirect process analysis using different models. The initial pathway modeling showed a conditional indirect effect of anticipatory anhedonia on delay discounting mediated by negative affect and moderated by suppression condition (template 14 in Haye's Process model in SPSS 2013).\n\nThis project designed two readily available experiment materials. First, the emotion regulation tasks in inducing negative affect derived from Dan-Galusser and Gross (2011) using IAPS (Lang, 1998) wherein 75 photos will be shown to participants. The other one is the delay discounting task using Philippine peso currency which is derived according to Rachlin, Raineri &amp; Gross\u2019s (1991) method of titrating hypothetical monetary rewards until the indifference points are reached in each delay time points.", "title": "Anhedonia and Emotion Regulation in Delay Discounting"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8w74s", "text": "", "title": "Prototeam Test Project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xsb42", "text": "", "title": "No blame, no shame?

Moral judgements and moral emotions are a crucial part of our daily lives, as they regulate our social behavior. From an evolutionary perspective, moral emotions have evolved by a need for approach and avoidance reactions in interpersonal exchange. So far, negative moral emotions like anger, indignation, and contempt have not been sufficiently distinguished and only rarely been analyzed by experimental investigations. Furthermore, prior research has neglected the social relations of interaction partners as well as the role of attributional concepts. In an experimental study (N = 211) we analyzed the specific antecedents of anger, indignation, and contempt by manipulating (1) the social relationship between a protagonist and their interaction partner and (2) effort invested by the interaction partner when striving for a joint goal. Results show that when positive goals cannot be attained together, anger is the predominant emotion. When the interaction partner fails to invest effort, this elicits more negative emotional reactions, while close social relationships reduce the emotional disapproval. We discuss our findings in the light of attributional concepts a comprehensive theory of moral emotions and actions.\n\nKeywords: moral emotions, anger, indignation, contempt, attribution", "title": "[Neg.

This may occur because improved perceptual organization reduces information load or because the repetitions capture attention. The implications of these explanations differ drastically for both the theoretical meaning of this effect and its potential value for applications in design of visual materials. If repetitions capture attention to the exclusion of other details, this should be considered when deciding whether to use repetitions in graphic designs. We manipulated the availability of general attention during a visual memory task by comparing groups of participants engaged in meaningless speech or attention-demanding continuous arithmetic. We also tracked eye movements as an implicit indicator of selective attention. Estimated memory capacity was always higher when color duplicates were tested, and under full attention conditions this bonus spilled over to the unique colors too. Analyses of gazes showed that with full attention, participants tended to glance earlier at duplicate colors during stimulus presentation but looked more at unique colors during the retention interval. This pattern of results suggests that the color-sharing bonus occurs because efficient perceptual organization of the display is enhanced by strategic attention allocation when attention is available.", "title": "Color-sharing Bonus"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2kab9", "text": "To form a coherent representation of the objects around us, the brain must group the different sensory features composing these objects. Here, we investigated whether actions contribute in this grouping process. In particular, we assessed whether action-outcome learning and prediction contribute to audiovisual temporal binding. Participants were presented with two audiovisual pairs: one pair was triggered by a left action, and the other by a right action. In a later test phase, the audio and visual components of these pairs were presented at different onset times. Participants judged whether they were simultaneous or not. To assess the role of action-outcome prediction on audiovisual simultaneity, each action triggered either the same audiovisual pair as in the learning phase (\u2018predicted\u2019 pair), or the pair that had previously been associated with the other action (\u2018unpredicted\u2019 pair). We found the time window within which auditory and visual events appeared simultaneous increased for predicted compared to unpredicted pairs. However, no change in audiovisual simultaneity was observed when audiovisual pairs followed visual cues, rather than voluntary actions. This suggests that only action-outcome learning promotes temporal grouping of audio and visual effects. In a second experiment we observed that changes in audiovisual simultaneity do not only depend on our ability to predict what outcomes our actions generate, but also on learning the delay between the action and the multisensory outcome. When participants learned that the delay between action and audiovisual pair was variable, the window of audiovisual simultaneity for predicted pairs increased, relative to a fixed action-outcome pair delay. This suggests that participants learn action-based predictions of audiovisual outcome, and adapt their temporal perception of outcome events based on such predictions.", "title": "Action-outcome learning and prediction shape the window of simultaneity of audiovisual outcomes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3y6we", "text": "The purpose of this project is to conduct an evaluation of the Tribal Health Profession Opportunity Grants (HPOG).

Study 3 of 3."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/f8tuj", "text": "Research findings suggest a fear of crime gender paradox with women reporting higher rates of fear than men, despite men\u2019s higher risk of stranger victimisation.  This research examined whether this gender paradox was unique to crime, whether the crime portrayed needed to also be threatening, and if this paradox could be generalised to other stressful stimuli (e.g. snakes).  In this 2 x 2 within-subjects design, participants viewed 80 images that\u2014as shown in a pilot study\u2014varied in terms of threat (high vs. low) and crime (high vs. low).  Men (n = 81) and women (n = 95) were recruited from a psychology program (M=31 years). Participants rated the 80 images in terms of threat, relation to crime, and level of fear.  Participants also rated their levels of generalised anxiety, social desirability of responses, experiences of victimisation and general fear of crime using traditional survey methods (e.g. Report on Government Services and Jackson\u2019s [2006] measure).  Participants\u2019 ratings of threat and crime replicated our pilot study and confirmed our image classification into the four groups. Regarding fear ratings, there were two two-way interactions: between threat and crime, and between threat and gender. Women reported more fear than men when responding to high threat images and high crime images. This supports the fear of crime gender paradox, yet also suggests that the paradox is not unique to crime but can be generalised to non-crime-related threatening stimuli.  Further, women reported significantly greater fear than men when rating non-threatening but crime-related images. The results suggest that men and women are responding differently to crime and threat. A limitation of this study is the use of non-clinical populations and a tertiary educated sample. There are implications for how men and women are supported in their reporting of emotions in the context of stressful situations.", "title": "Snakes, spiders, crime, oh my!

The registration contains the paper and all the MatLab files necessary to reproduce the results described in the paper and its corrigendum. \nThe authors noticed that there was a mistake during generating data for the paper. In the paper, we state that the model was trained with grammatical sentences and tested with a random mix of novel grammatical and agrammatical sentences. That was the plan, but we forgot to add the agrammatical sentences to the mix, so the model was only tested on novel grammatical sentences. \nAccordingly, the following sections in the published paper should be omitted:\n\u2022\tIn Section2.1: \u201cAdditionally, random agrammatical sentences were also generated.

The original (published) model could be ran with script_stack_figuregenerator_published.m.\nThe model can be fixed, if we pre-train the push-pop neurons and the decision neuron. The push-pop neurons should be able to decide whether two words are the same or different, and the decision neuron should recognize if the stack is not empty.

This same research is at risk of being devalued because of the increased evidence of the prevalence of data mining, publication bias, and other problematic research practices and norms. In order to combat these problematic norms, there is growing interest in transparency practices in the social sciences. At present, the bulk of this work is centered around randomized controlled trials. These experiments, however, constitute only a small fraction of all social science research. As a result, in order to improve research transparency in the social sciences, it is crucial to develop ways of improving research practices in non-experimental work as well. In this paper, I propose a method for using pre-analysis plans in observational research. I suggest three scenarios in which pre-analysis plans can be credibly applied to non-experimental research designs: studies using future events or data that has not yet been collected; studies using confidential data; and studies using data that are not available to the public without purchase.

Social Media + Society. doi: 10.1177/2056305116634368\n\nShort summary:\nIn this study, we hypothesized that users perceive specific information as differently private depending on their personal privacy preference, but generally show the same disclosure management pattern: the higher the perceived privacy level of an information, the less frequently it will be shared. We tested the hypothesis using an online survey with 316 German SNS users. The findings suggest that respondents engaged in disclosure management taking both communication channel and type of information into account. We further found that trust towards SNS contacts and use of privacy settings significantly influenced disclosure management in one-to-many (status updates), but not in one-to-one communications situations (chat conversations). The results complement existing research by showing the pivotal role of individual privacy perceptions in explaining users\u2019 privacy management in the social web.", "title": "Disclosure Management on Social Network Sites - Replication Material"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5izyb", "text": "", "title": "Start/stop + SPF"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cqsnj", "text": "Test the effect of relational infromation on deliberate versus automatic evaluation", "title": "Project: Relations - deliberate versus automatic evaluation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/i5ekv", "text": "", "title": "Start/stop + IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/u39dr", "text": "", "title": "Study summary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fvra2", "text": "", "title": "Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zb8y4", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pft36", "text": "", "title": "Raw data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6w5xg", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bjk87", "text": "", "title": "Manuscript"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gjc53", "text": "", "title": "Study summary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2dsw8", "text": "", "title": "Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/x7av9", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vjrtg", "text": "", "title": "Raw data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sjv6m", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/j7xer", "text": "", "title": "Program"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ncijy", "text": "", "title": "IRB approval"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6c9zn", "text": "", "title": "Method Study 1"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xt79v", "text": "", "title": "Effortful Anchoring: The Paradoxical Effect of Depletion on the Anchoring-and-Adjustment Bias"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/yx3cg", "text": "", "title": "Effects of Framing on Sources of Uncertainty"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8yex6", "text": "", "title": "R code as of 1/22/2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xn38g", "text": "", "title": "Raw Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/z6vbd", "text": "", "title": "Quant Seminar Presentation 2/12/2016"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ad78w", "text": "", "title": "Can Politicians Police Themselves?

When older adults play specific video games (violent and non-violent) do they have concerns that those particular games will influence society in a negative way.  Expected Sample: Participants will be age 50+.  Due to the university being located in a smaller community I expect a relatively smaller sample and given no incentive is provided for participation, between 40-60.  I certify that data collection will neither be stopped nor continued in relation to observed p-values.  I expect data collection to continue through December, 2014.Video Game Manipulation.  Matched violent and non-violent games will be used, specifically Tomb Raider and FIFA for the XBOX One.Pretest Forms: In addition to demographic questions including their own prior use of video games, respondents will fill out a 50-item Big 5 Inventory taken from the International Personality Item Pool.  They will also answer 4 questions regarding the impact of video games on society, interspersed with 5 distractor items.  Posttest Forms: Posttest will include the same 4 questions as during the pretest, however, specifying the impact of the game the participant just played rather than video games in general.  Posttest also include 6 open ended qualitative questions regarding the participants\u2019 impression of video games and the game they just played.  Basic Design: Participants will be randomized to play video games as noted above.  Main analyses will be mixed designs (time x game) controlling for prior video game use.  Groups should not differ at pre-test on their impressions of video games, but it will be curious to see if their impression of specific games they just played are milder than their overall impressions or if it matters if the game they had just played was violent or non-violent.", "title": "Older Adults and video games"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/muwtx", "text": "", "title": "The USA Project II (Illinois Institute of Technology)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vg3h4", "text": "", "title": "The strength of negative features in shaping similarity"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4gmhc", "text": "", "title": "The strength of negative features in shaping similarity: Implications for creating the brand image of a city"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/upnv3", "text": "", "title": "Falling back on the couch"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/y56c4", "text": "", "title": "Self Control and Media Use"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pf8na", "text": "", "title": "\u00ab Does social mobility make us forget where we are from?

The present study aims to identify central features by quantifying expert perceptions of the attributes most central to narcissism. To accomplish this, we developed a comprehensive list of attributes associated with narcissism and had 49 self-identified experts (17 women; 23 from clinical psychology and 22 from social/personality psychology) rate these characteristics as well as provide their opinions on several issues related to the conceptualization of narcissism. Experts generally believe that the grandiose features of narcissism are more central to the construct than the vulnerable features. However, differences between clinical and social/personality psychologists were evident, especially with respect to the relevance of self-esteem. These results help to identify areas of controversy that can be resolved to better integrate the field. Based on the results, we suggest two strategies which could be implemented immediately: (1) specify the kind of narcissism being assessed and (2) consider using assessments of the full range of narcissistic features in future research to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the construct.", "title": "Experts\u2019 Views Regarding the Conceptualization of Narcissism"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bwa75", "text": "An archive of the American Gut project from https://github.com/biocore/American-Gut", "title": "American Gut"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bm47u", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/m8byt", "text": "", "title": "An Evaluation of Biofield Treatment on Thermal, Physical and Structural Properties of Cadmium Powder"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/w5ery", "text": "", "title": "Characterization of Physical, Thermal and Structural Properties of Chromium (VI) Oxide Powder: Impact of Biofield Treatment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6r5vu", "text": "", "title": "Characterization of Physical and Structural Properties of Brass Powder After Biofield Treatment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fwzy4", "text": "Fully printable (except for the lenses) Microscope.

First, we describe the inductive approach, drawing from empirical analyses of 20 of the items. Second we describe the deductive approach toward scale construction. In addition to describing the processes of scale construction, we also describe the attributes and psychometric properties of the scales derived. Finally, we assess the inter-construct validity of inductive vis-a-vis deductive approaches, finding high correlations between the two sets of measures. In addition, we draw from use of the 40 MoA items in the extant literature to provide a comparative analyses of the EAMMI items. We find that, despite divergent 'styles' of psychometric reasoning, both approaches are consistent with the strengths and he challenges of constructing scales in the literature. We conclude with a review of the lessons learned.

The people recruited to the study will have a diagnosis of psychosis/schizophrenia.\nThe presentation will be based on meta\u00adcognitive training (MCT) for psychosis, which is a psycho\u00adeducational programme. Specifically, the jumping\u00adto\u00adconclusions modules of the MCT training package will be adapted for use in this study. It aims to reduce the jumping\u00adto\u00adconclusions (JTC) bias, which is a common thinking style of people with psychosis. It describes the tendency of those who experience psychosis to make judgements or decisions quicker and based upon less evidence. Research suggests that the JTC bias is influential in people developing psychosis. It has also been suggested that JTC affects the capacity (or ability) of people experiencing psychosis to make decisions about their treatment and to understand treatment options available to them.\nParticipants will be randomly allocated to either of two groups: a) the presentation discussed above or b) a control condition consisting of a general psychology lecture. Both will be delivered by the main researcher. Condition B is designed only to give equivalent researcher attention between groups. The MCT presentation is not intended (or suggested by research) to significantly reduce psychosis symptoms, so is not intended as a therapy. Participants in each condition will receive equivalent time and attention.\nDecision\u00admaking capacity will be assessed using a psychological interview scheduled designed for this purpose called the MacCAT\u00adT. Similar interviews and questionnaires will be used to measure the extent of the JTC bias alongside severity of psychosis, anxiety and depression.

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either H1 or H0, and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.\n", "title": "Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mfz2v", "text": "", "title": "\"It's Bigger Than Hip-Hop\": Rap Lyrics, Stereotype Threat and African Americans"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4xrcq", "text": "", "title": "Personal Trauma and Affective Forecasting: Reactions to \tLarge Scale and Small Scale Tragedies"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/97bxp", "text": "", "title": "Examining the relevance of daily social support from one\u2019s partner for physical activity in the context of a self-regulation intervention"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/dvgu6", "text": "", "title": "Blurred Lines: The Influence of Social Status on Public Perceptions of Potentially Criminal Incidents"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zaf6t", "text": "", "title": "Get Excited: Reappraising Pre-Performance Anxiety as Excitement"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/au67n", "text": "", "title": "Do Perceivers Categorize Faces in Terms of Intersectional or Superordinate Identities?"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zjy9c", "text": "", "title": "SPSP 2016 Poster"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7xhjr", "text": "", "title": "Changing implicit theories of personality to improve acute social stress responses in teenagers"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5tywg", "text": "", "title": "Construal Level and Communication among Intra-minority Intergroup Relations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4dmyz", "text": "", "title": "The Complexity of Loyalty Conceptions and their Relation to Whistleblowing"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7s425", "text": "", "title": "Using Imagined Intergroup Contact to Reduce Transprejudice"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ub3qc", "text": "", "title": "Bringing the Relationship into Health Behavior Change: A Dyadic Approach to the Theory of Planned Behavior"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/eq5af", "text": "", "title": "An Atheoretical Empirical Method for the Identification and Organization of Content-Based Differences in Pornography"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rw4hn", "text": "", "title": "Children and parents' acculturation discrepancies: longitudinal relationships with the well-being of immigrant children."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/h9gu3", "text": "", "title": "Who's to Blame?

In study 2, 50 participants rated 500 opposite-sex face stimuli on their ideal partner preferences and these ratings were correlated with the relevant trait ratings for each ideal partner factor.

That is, do individuals tend to initiate relationships with others who more closely match their ideal preferences?While some studies have shown that ideal mate standards influence relationship initiation (Burriss, Welling, &amp; Puts, 2011; DeBruine et al., 2006; P\u00e9russe, 1994), other studies have challenged the role that ideal preferences play in actual mate selection (Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2008; Eastwick, Finkel, &amp; Eagly, 2011). One major limitation of existing research in this area is that mate preferences are often measured retrospectively, after participants become involved in a relationship. In addition, studies that have attempted to evaluate the link between ideal mate standards and actual relationship initiation have tended to focus on interpersonal attraction rather than actual relationship initiation, such as speed dating contexts.The present study aims to resolve the inconsistencies in this area by examining ideal mate preferences and actual relationship initiation over an extended period of time (6 months) in a sample of individuals who are single at the initial testing session (i.e. not involved in a romantic relationship). If and when these individuals enter a relationship, the attributes of the new partner will be assessed, as well as how the new relationship progresses over time. This research will determine whether people enter relationships with individuals who more closely match their ideal mate preferences (or particular ideal preferences, and not others), and/or whether relationships develop more positively when greater ideal consistency exists. *Note, at time of registration the majority of data have been collected, but no data have been looked at or analyzed (a  number of participants are completing monthly surveys and all data should be collected by August 2014).", "title": "Singles Study--Predictive Validity of Ideal Partner Preferences"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/k93rz", "text": "", "title": "Empathy &amp; Prosociality: Key Predictors of Connectedness &amp; Well-being in Social Networks"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hvrnq", "text": "", "title": "Study 5 Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/a6swg", "text": "", "title": "The Impact of Differentiation of Self and Trait Displaced Aggression on Aggressive Behavior"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p3b6u", "text": "", "title": "Study 4 Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g65e4", "text": "", "title": "Study 4 Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5u6ed", "text": "", "title": "Study 3 Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/b7gt2", "text": "", "title": "Study 2 Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p2mza", "text": "", "title": "Study 1 Analyses"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bf75m", "text": "", "title": "Study 1"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fx5m7", "text": "", "title": "\u201cSleeping\u201d together, happy together: Affection mediates the association between sexual activity and well-being"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/48rn2", "text": "", "title": "Developing an Attainment Value Intervention"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/r7vpd", "text": "", "title": "The Effects of Biological Sex, Religiosity, and Past Experiences with Cheating on Perceptions of Infidelity"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wj4hr", "text": "", "title": "Growing Together: Growth Classroom Orientation Leads to STEM Communal Affordances and Interest"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/dg57x", "text": "", "title": "Organizational Stress Moderates the Relationship between Mental Health Provider Adaptability and Organizational Commitment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vgpsh", "text": "", "title": "Individual differences moderate the effect of social multitasking behavior on course performance"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qhr8d", "text": "", "title": "Emotion Words: \"Facing\" Change Poster 086 Fugate"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qtaj9", "text": "", "title": "Effect of Anti-gay Humor on Prejudice Suppression and Rebound"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kupg3", "text": "", "title": "Sleep Changes in Homo erectus: The Implications for Creativity and Emotionality in Later Hominins"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zruy7", "text": "", "title": "Evaluating the effects of a pre-genetic cancer risk assessment telephone intervention on anxiety and cancer genetics knowledge"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/z9cnk", "text": "Basic variables for the 4002 \"Significant Figures\" analyzed in Murray, Human Accomplishment (2003)", "title": "Murray/Human Accomplishment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vb8t7", "text": "", "title": "Perceived Discrimination and Physical Health: An Update of Pascoe &amp; Richman\u2019s (2009) Meta-Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/vmp2c", "text": "", "title": "Ambivalence and the Attitude Similarity Effect on Attraction"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qgfts", "text": "", "title": "SPSP Poster"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/h5fut", "text": "", "title": "The Sense of Nonsense: Benefits of Superstitious Rituals in Response to Adversity"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/auts8", "text": "PhD research from Zimbabwe", "title": "The impact of land reform on the status of carnivores"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/dn3xy", "text": "The data extracted from the Health Information Systems (HIS) detailed indicator reports used to generate the experimental stimuli.

Within this collection of tools, techniques, and methodologies, the ontology is a basic building block. Yet, despite the interest and uptake in semantics, there still exist several challenges to consuming semantic data and reusing existing ontologies.\n\nOne challenge is that ontologies can be created by varying means (manual vs auto- mated), varying methodologies (e.g. the Fox and McGuinness method [1]), and to varying levels of domain and logical expressiveness. Ultimately, the goal is for wide spread uptake and reuse of ontologies. Yet, attempts to describe an entire domain within an ontology have led to difficulties in reuse both within the geosciences and the broader Semantic Web community. It has become apparent over the past few years that common conceptual patterns are repeated in ontologies emerging from different communities and domains. Analogous to using design patterns to create software, the study of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) [2,3] advocates the reuse of small modular ontologies as opposed to large ontologies de- scribing full domain areas. This modularizing of ontologies into reusable patterns (ODPs) enhances reuse and simplifies interoperability issues [4]. Not surprisingly, Linked Data [5, 6], which is based on data published and consumed against ontology schema, have also not seen as much consumption as would be liked.\n\nRecent research [7] has shown that ODPs can also be beneficial in facilitating more, and easier, Linked Data consumption. The ODP research area is new and the basic benefits of ODPs are just now beginning to be validated in the broader Semantic Web community. At present, limited validation within the geosciences has occurred. \n\nLinked Data and ontologies are at the heart of the ESIP's Semantic Web Committee\u2019s Strategic Vision and Road Map. This ESIP funded testbed project will provide crucial initial feedback regarding the benefits of ODPs in geoscience data publication and consumption.\n\n[1] http://tw.rpi.edu/web/doc/TWC SemanticWebMethodology \n\n[2] E.

Murray et al. (2002) found that individuals scoring lower (vs. higher) on self-esteem were more sensitive to perceived rejection from their romantic partner and reacted to this perceived threat by feeling less positive about their romantic partner, diminished closeness in their relationship, and heightened self-doubt. Moreover, the original researchers found that, in reality, the partners of lower and higher self-esteem persons reported similar levels of forgiveness, satisfaction, and other relationship outcomes, meaning that the increased defensiveness felt by lower self-esteem persons when they perceived rejection was unwarranted. This research has important implications for how people approach their relationships and negotiate conflict. Replicating the original study, we will use a paper-and-pencil task to lead half of the experimental participants (1/4 of the total participants) to believe that their partner perceives a large number of faults in them (the other half of participants will not be led to believe this). All participants will then complete questionnaires regarding themselves, their partner, and their relationship.", "title": "The Experiences of Dating Couples: Replication of Murray et al (2002), Study 3"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ce9vh", "text": "", "title": "Too Black?

Analyses compared voting intentions expressed before vs. after the initial Ebola outbreak, and assessed correlations between internet search activity and voting intentions.

This limitation can be mitigated by the use of focused attention: if attention is drawn to the relevant working-memory content prior to test, performance improves (the so-called retro-cue benefit). This study tests two explanations of the retro-cue benefit: (1) Focused attention protects memory representations from interference by visual input at test, and (2) focusing attention enhances retrieval. Across six experiments using color recognition and color reproduction tasks, we varied the amount of color interference at test, and the delay between a retrieval cue (i.e., the retro-cue) and the memory test. Retro-cue benefits were larger when the memory test introduced interfering visual stimuli, showing that the retro-cue effect is in part due to protection from visual interference. Yet, when visual interference was held constant, retro-cue benefits were still obtained whenever the retro-cue enabled retrieval of an object from visual working memory but delayed response selection. Our results show that accessible information in visual working memory might be lost in the processes of testing memory due to visual interference and incomplete retrieval. This is not an inevitable state of affairs, though: Focused attention can be used to get the most out of visual working memory.

The goal of the present study is to investigate the impact of induced analytical processing on the misinformation effect.", "title": "The Effects of Analytical Thinking on Misinformation Susceptibility"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jqxfg", "text": "", "title": "Sensitivity to Hierarchy Paper"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/q68yb", "text": "", "title": "Methods"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pv5ng", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d9j46", "text": "", "title": "Companion versus comparison research"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ps4c6", "text": "", "title": "Study 3 data and syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/udt4g", "text": "", "title": "Study 2 data and syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nqy5w", "text": "", "title": "Study 1 data and syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/drwh8", "text": "", "title": "Libraries Will Be an Asset for Us: Emerging Roles for Academic Libraries in Civic Data Partnerships"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/h7xy8", "text": "", "title": "Summary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kir42", "text": "", "title": "raw data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wpj7g", "text": "", "title": "Romero_NIKA2_v2"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/br23t", "text": "", "title": "Future (Sub)Millimeter Development in Japan"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/yu5kx", "text": "", "title": "Project: The effect of action valence on stimulus evaluation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/de2sn", "text": "", "title": "The effect of action valence on stimulus evaluation (pairfocus4)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tzy7e", "text": "", "title": "Study summary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/q4f6t", "text": "", "title": "Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wup36", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wmxsg", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3vc6a", "text": "", "title": "Program"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/z52ap", "text": "", "title": "Plan"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/atyc5", "text": "", "title": "The effect of action valence on stimulus evaluation (pairfocus5)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/36cqk", "text": "", "title": "Study summary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pv3td", "text": "", "title": "Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g68bu", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/f92un", "text": "", "title": "Program"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/84pnx", "text": "", "title": "Plan"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/y8upf", "text": "", "title": "Willman_LSST"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/x3czf", "text": "", "title": "Hostile Mediators"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bpt8v", "text": "", "title": "werthimer_advanced_radio_instrumentation_and_seti"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6k2xd", "text": "", "title": "Pulsar tests of general relativity"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/k8na7", "text": "", "title": "Hunter_Measuring the luminosity of massive protostars via their millimeter continuum brightness temperature"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wtmxb", "text": "", "title": "Status and Justice Orientation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tevg2", "text": "", "title": "Ransom_Physics with Pulsars"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/k267c", "text": "", "title": "How Tos"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8ysme", "text": "Data files (with codebook) and procedures/materials for the article entitled \"Money Cues Increase Agency and Decrease Prosociality Among Children: Early Signs of Market-Mode Behaviors\" by Agata Gasiorowska, Lan Nguyen Chaplin, Tomasz Zaleskiewicz, Sandra Wygrab, and Kathleen D.

In two reanalyzes and three new experiments, we investigate differences between experience-based and description-based decisions using a parametric approach based on Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). Once controlling for sampling biases, we consistently find a reversal of the typical Description-Experience gap, that is, a reduced sensitivity to probabilities and increased overweighting of small probabilities in decisions from experience as compared to decisions from descriptions. This finding supports the hypothesis that regression to the mean effects in probability estimation are a crucial source of differences between both presentation formats. Further analyses identified task specific information asymmetry prevalent in gambles involving certainty as a third source of differences.

Here, we performed a longitudinal multimodal MRI study\u2014including structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and perfusion MRI\u2014to investigate progressive brain changes over one year in a group of older PD patients at a moderate stage of disease..\nMethods: Twenty-three non-demented PD (mean age (SD) = 69.5 (6.4) years, disease duration (SD) = 5.6 (4.3) years) and 23 matched control participants (mean age: 70.6 (6.8)) completed extensive neuropsychological and clinical assessment, and multimodal 3T MRI scanning at baseline and one year later. We used a voxel-based approach to assess change over time and group-by-time interactions for cerebral structural and perfusion metrics. \nResults: Compared to controls, in PD participants there was localized grey matter atrophy over time in bilateral inferior and right middle temporal, and left orbito-frontal cortices. Using a voxel-based approach that focused on the centers of principal white matter tracts, the PD and control cohorts exhibited similar levels of change in DTI metrics. There was no significant change in perfusion, cognitive, or motor severity measures.\nConclusions: In a cohort of older, non-demented PD participants, macrostructural MRI detected atrophy in the PD group compared with the control group in temporal and orbito-frontal cortices.

However, little is known about the individual contribution of each subtest to these predictions and the underlying constructs of UFOV performance remain a topic of debate.\nMethod: We investigated the incremental validity of UFOV subtests for the prediction of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) performance in two independent datasets, the SKILL (n = 828) and ACTIVE (n = 2426) studies. We, then, explored the cognitive and visual abilities assessed by UFOV using a range of neuropsychological and vision tests administered in the SKILL study.\nResults: In the four subtest variant of UFOV, only subtests 2 and 3 consistently made independent contributions to the prediction of IADL performance across three different behavioral measures. In all cases, the incremental validity of UFOV subtests 1 and 4 was negligible. Furthermore, we found that UFOV was related to processing speed, general non-speeded cognition, and visual function; the omission of subtests 1 and 4 from the test score did not affect these associations. \nConclusions: UFOV subtests 1 and 4 appear to be of limited use to predict IADL and possibly other everyday activities.

Interestingly, although objects are usually considered \u201cbetter\u201d when they are bigger in size, objects described with linguistic diminution can also refer to those that are emotionally positive. Across three experiments conducted in Polish, we examined this lexical variability in terms of mood (Experiment1), subjective quality and monetary value (Experiment 2), and choice selection (Experiment 3). Overall, we found that people evaluate objects differently depending on the linguistic form (i.e., with or without diminution) with which they are described.

The table will cross a) whether the key effect was judged to be successfully replicated by analysis 4b, with b) whether the MC was judged to be a successful replication of the original MC by the same criterion.", "title": "Check Their Head: Implications of the Scarcity and Replicability of Manipulation Checks from the Reproducibility Project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d52st", "text": "", "title": "OpenWIM-Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/tynf7", "text": "", "title": "Meiacanthus atrodorsalis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/9x74m", "text": "This project is dedicated to sharing information  about how to best start and maintain partnerships between scholars and other entities", "title": "CUR Innovation and Collaborations Task Force"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nmrp5", "text": "This project explores how different forms of confidence vary with age.", "title": "Overconfidence over the life-span (OOLS)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gu89e", "text": "", "title": "SMDM Poster"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ejfg6", "text": "", "title": "On_Metacognition_and_Culture"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ys7g6", "text": "This archive contains the raw datasets that are discussed in the book Tyneside Neighbourhoods: Deprivation, Social Life and Social Behaviour in one British City (OpenBook Publishers, 2016).

For just as long, a heated debate has persisted regarding the effects of these inspections and of OSHA\u2019s regulations more broadly.  While some claim OSHA destroys jobs without meaningfully improving workplace safety, others argue inspections save lives at low costs to employers and employees.  Still others posit that inspections have little effect and waste taxpayer dollars.  \n\nIn the current study, we propose to evaluate OSHA\u2019s largest non-construction intervention\u2014Site Specific Targeting (SST)\u2014which targets some of the most hazardous workplace in the country for enforcement inspections. SST uses random assignment to allocate inspections, allowing us to analyze inspection effectiveness as with a randomized trial.  Among establishments eligible for a randomized inspection, we will test whether being randomly chosen for an SST inspection reduces an establishment\u2019s subsequent injury rates and improves compliance with OSHA regulations.

Five groups were selected for study; Christianity, Environmental groups, Healthy-living groups, Gender and Nationality. These groups were selected on a priori grounds because we expected them (a) to differ in holisticness, and (b) to prescribe content (e.g., philosophies) which are reasonably consistent or consensually shared across group members. We hypothesized that the first three groups (Christianity, Environmental and Healthy-living) would be perceived as prescribing a philosophy for life (i.e., highly holistic). It was expected that the more strongly self-defining these social identities were, the more strongly they would fit or overlap with other social identities within the self-concept. In contrast, we expected the latter two groups (Gender and Nationality) to be perceived as less holistic and therefore unrelated to inter-identity fit.\n\nAssociated datasets:\n\"PilotData MLM\": Pilot data set for multi-level model\n\"PilotData\": SPSS Pilot Data", "title": "Pilot Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8cesx", "text": "It can be hard for individuals to manage multiple group identities within their self-concept (e.g., being a Christian and a woman).

Startle potentiation is widely used in clinical and affective science and there are multiple approaches for its quantification. The three most commonly used approaches quantify startle potentiation as the increase in startle response from a neutral to threat condition based on 1) raw potentiation, 2) standardized potentiation or 3) percent-change potentiation. These three quantification approaches may yield qualitatively different conclusions about effects of independent variables on affect when within or between group differences exist for startle response in the neutral condition. Accordingly, we directly compared these quantification approaches in a shock-threat task using four independent variables known to influence startle response in the no-threat condition: probe intensity, time (i.e., habituation), alcohol administration, and individual differences in general startle reactivity measured at baseline. We confirmed the expected effects of time, alcohol, and general startle reactivity on affect using self-reported fear/anxiety as a criterion. The percent-change approach displayed apparent artifact across all four independent variables, which raises substantial concerns about its validity. Both raw and standardized potentiation approaches were stable across probe intensity and time, which supports their validity. However, only raw potentiation displayed effects that were consistent with a priori specifications and/or the self-report criterion for the effects of alcohol and general startle reactivity. Supplemental analyses of reliability and validity for each approach provided additional evidence in support of raw potentiation.", "title": "Empirically-based comparisons of the reliability and validity of common quantification approaches for eyeblink startle potentiation in humans  (Data and study materials)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hs5fk", "text": "Discriminatory experiences are not only momentarily distressing, but can also increase risk for lasting\nphysical and psychological problems.

Given the gravity of this problem, this research focuses on an individual\ndifference, trait mindfulness, as a protective factor in the association between discrimination and\ndepressive symptoms. In a community sample of 605 individuals, trait mindfulness dampens the relationship\nbetween perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms.

R. &amp; Panter, A. T. (2011-2012). The WECT Project: Workplace experiences and character traits [project information]. Available at: Open Science Framework https://osf.io/w3hgr/.\n\nThe Work Experiences and Character Traits (WECT) project investigates how character, personality, emotions, and treatment by managers and co-workers affect the frequency with which workers engage in ethical and unethical behavior at their jobs. This interdisciplinary research is at the intersection of social/personality psychology and organizational behavior. In this project, U.S. adults with full-time employment participated in a three-month online diary study about \u201cweekly experiences in the workplace.\u201d They first provided detailed information about their jobs and completed a battery of measures assessing various dimensions of character and personality. To measure character, we assessed a variety of individual differences that have been linked to ethical and unethical choices in prior research (e.g., guilt proneness, honesty-humility, empathic concern, moral identity, cognitive moral development). Following the initial survey, participants completed an online survey once a week for 12 week in which they reported the frequency with which they performed organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and counterproductive work behaviors (CWB). The OCB items assessed ethical organizational behaviors (e.g., helping co-workers with work and personal responsibilities, coming in early or staying late without pay), whereas the CWB items assessed unethical organizational behaviors (e.g., verbally or physically abusing co-workers, stealing from one\u2019s employer). The weekly surveys also asked participants about the extent to which they experienced various emotions during the previous week, and how they were treated by managers and co-workers (e.g., the frequency of interpersonal conflict, workplace ostracism, and abusive supervision). In addition to collecting self-reports of personality and behavior, we also collected observer-reports by surveying co-workers of the participants. By examining the factor structure of and longitudinal relations among character, personality, emotions, and workplace experiences, we hope to be able to determine the ways in which these individual differences and situational influences affect ethical and unethical behavior in the workplace.\n\nThe WECT Project\u2019s Principal Investigators are: Taya R. Cohen, Ph.D. (Carnegie Bosch Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior &amp; Theory, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University) and Abigail T. Panter, Ph.D. (Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education &amp; Professor of Psychology, L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). \n\nThe WECT project was made possible through the support of Grant 15519 from The Character Project at Wake Forest University and the John Templeton Foundation to Taya R.

Vancleef, Elke Smeets &amp; Madelon L. Peters\nDepartment of Clinical Psychological Science\nMaastricht University\n\nIntroduction\nExperiencing pain is suggested to not only lead to difficulties in physical and emotional functioning but also in executive functioning. Optimism reflects a general tendency to expect that good things will happen in the future. Recently, we demonstrated that increasing optimism counteracted the deteriorating effect of pain on executive task performance in healthy subjects. The present study was set up to examine the effects of an 8-week internet-based positive psychology intervention in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is hypothesized that: (1) the online positive psychology intervention will lead to an increase in positive states and traits (e.g. optimism) and decrease negative states and traits, compared to the waiting list condition and (2) the online positive psychology intervention leads to improved cognitive task performance (i.e. executive functioning).\nMethod\nParticipants were randomly assigned to the positive psychology intervention (n=73) or a control waiting list condition (n=46). The positive psychology intervention consisted of four different positive psychology exercises: self-compassion training, gratitude journaling, savoring and best possible self-visualization. Pain interference, depression, wellbeing and disability were measured pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, patients completed a cognitive tasks battery pre- and post-intervention, measuring multiple aspects of executive functioning, such as inhibition, task switching and working memory. \nResults\nThe positive psychology intervention significantly increased self-compassion, positive affect, optimism, and decreased catastrophic thoughts about pain, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, results indicate that cognitive task performance improved from pre to post intervention, but this was not specific to those participants that received the positive psychology intervention (i.e. general learning effect).  \nDiscussion \nThese results demonstrate that increasing optimism and positive affect by an online positive psychology intervention leads to improved emotional functioning in patients with chronic pain.", "title": "A positive psychology internet-based intervention improves emotional, but not cognitive functioning in chronic pain patients."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/87esy", "text": "", "title": "Experiment 2 - Syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sge37", "text": "", "title": "Experiment 1 - Syntax"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6ufgz", "text": "", "title": "Experiment 2 - Database"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5up9y", "text": "Looking into the language use of spree killers and mass murderers.", "title": "Spree Killer's Language Use"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/9wybf", "text": "There has not been a systemic appraisal and pooled analysis of results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the impact of microcredit programs on overall economic welfare.

Much of this interest is due to results from the Dictator Game, which involves one participant choosing how much of a windfall endowment to give to a passive recipient. Non-zero giving in this game contradict theories that describe human economic behavior as entirely self-interested. However, inferring other-regarding preferences from Dictator Game giving alone is problematic because it is unclear whether the psychological states that motivate Dictator Game giving are selfish or altruistic. Experimental social psychology has at least two major contributions it can make to adjudicate the matter. First, the Dictator Game\u2019s structure only allows the Dictator to give or do nothing, which represents what psychologists call a demand characteristic. Demand characteristics suggest that a certain action\u2014in this game, giving to the Recipient\u2014 is expected of the participant. Demand can lead participants to act like \u201cgood subjects,\u201d confounding the interpretation of results. ). Experiments that have detected demand in the Dictator Game have changed the nature of the task, and so it is unknown how removing demand but keeping a standard giving decision constant would affect giving. Second, many social psychology experiments show that empathy is an important psychological state for motivating behavior with genuinely selfless intentions. If Dictator Game giving really is altruistic, empathic affect should motivate Dictator Game giving because the presence of empathy indicates ultimately altruistic desires. However, many experiments supporting the empathy-altruism hypothesis also contain demand to be helpful, and so the true magnitude of helping that empathy motivates is unknown. To understand whether Dictator Game giving is psychologically altruistic and whether empathy motivates helping in the absence of demand it is necessary to conduct a modified Dictator Game that both eliminates demand characteristics and manipulates empathy.\n\nTo do so, we have designed an experiment with a 2 (demand and no demand) x 3 (high empathy, low empathy, control) factorial design. We intend to run participants with random assignment until we have collected at least 50 non-suspicious participants for each condition. The experiment has the following procedure:\n\n1. After consenting to participate, participants will be seated in a laboratory in a private room for 40-60 minutes. \n2. Then they will be told that they will paired with an anonymous partner to either send or receive a letter (in fact, all participants will be assigned to the letter-reader condition). The apparent purpose of the experiment is to learn about how people evaluate the literary qualities of stories written in the first-person. The letter-writer is instructed to write a letter about something going on in his or her life right now. The partner will read the letter and fill out questionnaire(s) about it. The letter-receiver will then send one of the questionnaires back to the letter-writer to inform further tasks that the letter-writer will ostensibly complete. Participants are also told that people in these types of studies often like to be able to freely express themselves; consequently, the participant and partner will be allowed to put anything in the envelope that will fit. Provided examples will include a note and a doodle.\n3. Before this process begins, the participant will be told that he/she won $10 through a lottery, and that the other person did not earn any money. In the \u201cdemand\u201d condition of the experiment, the participant will be told that he/she may transfer none, some, or all of the money to the other person if they wish by putting the money in the envelope when they send their letter (along with whatever else they decide to send). In the \u201cno-demand\u201d condition the ability to send money is not mentioned. \n4. Participants will be assigned, ostensibly randomly, to be the receiver of the other person\u2019s letter. While they wait, they will complete an Incomplete Figure Task and fill out the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding, Impression Management subscale, ostensibly because of each task\u2019s relation to interpreting literature.\n5. Then the participant receives the other person\u2019s envelope. Unless they are in the no-instructions condition, participants are also given instructions to take a certain perspective while reading the story. Specifically, participants will be instructed to either take the partner\u2019s perspective while reading the partner\u2019s letter (in the \u201chigh empathy\u201d conditions), try to remain as objective as possible while reading the letter (in the \u201clow empathy\u201d conditions), or read no instructions.\n6.  After reading the instructions, participants will open the other person\u2019s letter. The envelope will include a letter (see questionnaire/instructions document), which\u2014as affirmed by independent raters blind to the purpose of the experiment\u2014 will elicit perceptions of distress and financial need (unless they are in the control condition, in which case they will receive a neutral note with no mention of financial need), and will also include a doodle.\n7. Participants will indicate their feelings while reading the letter by responding to a questionnaire consisting of a list of 30 adjectives describing various emotions. They will then be instructed to fill out the Feedback questionnaire based on what they read (a sham questionnaire with a few manipulation checks), put it in the provided envelope and anything else that he or she may like to send to the other person that will fit in the envelope. Participants will then be instructed to seal the envelope and give it to the experimenter, who will pretend to go give the envelope to the partner.\n8. After participants have finished, they will be probed for suspicion of deception and then debriefed. The participant will keep all $10, even if he/she sent some of it to the (sham) letter-writer. The concealed interest is in determining whether participants adjust the inequality between themselves and their partner. They could do so by placing some of their bonus payment in the envelope (which the partner will ostensibly ultimately receive and open). We anticipate that participants will take approximately 60 minutes to complete the study.\n\nPlanned Statistical Analyses\n\n\tWe will average all of the distress adjectives to get distress scores for each participant, and average all of the empathy adjectives to get an empathy score for each participant. Then we will run a one-way ANOVA to compare average empathic affect and distress in the high-empathy, low-empathy, and no-instructions groups.\n\tTo measure the effect of demand and empathy on giving, we will run a multiple regression analysis (independent variables: demand vs. no demand, high-empathy vs. low-empathy vs. no-instructions, plus the terms to represent the interaction of demand and empathy condition); dependent variable: amount of dollars transferred to the partner). To evaluate the interaction between desire for social approval and demand on giving, we will run a regression analysis (independent variable: demand vs. no-demand; dependent variable: amount of dollars transferred to the partner) with BIDR score as a covariate. Depending on which fits better, we will likely use a Poisson or negative binominal model as the low number of positive transfers expected in the no-demand conditions suggests that the results will not fit well with an ordinary least squares model. \n\nPredictions\n\nPrediction 1: We predict main effects for the demand variable and empathy variable: Participants assigned to the demand conditions and the empathy conditions should evince higher proportions of DG giving and higher mean levels of DG giving than participants in the no-demand condition or low-empathy and control conditions.\nPrediction 2: We predict an empathy*demand interaction: Empathy will increase giving more in the demand conditions than in the no-demand conditions. \nPrediction 3: We predict a demand*social desirability interaction: Social desirability scores (as measured by the BIDR) will be positively associated with levels of giving in the demand conditions but not in the no-demand conditions.", "title": "Demand characteristics in experiments on altruism"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8b3hf", "text": "", "title": "Evidence for-and-against a simple interpretation of the less-is-more effect"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/25gbv", "text": "", "title": "test"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/24gzw", "text": "", "title": "Corruption and Military Expenditure in 2010"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cgbh7", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/w2pz7", "text": "", "title": "component0"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/q7rsm", "text": "", "title": "Telenovela field experiment: materials data and code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ngm4h", "text": "", "title": "Open Materials and Data for Greenberg &amp; Spiller, Psychological Science"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xtf7e", "text": "", "title": "Experiment 1 - Database"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jqh8v", "text": "cience Data Publishing is a data file management and publishing interface developed for storing and sharing data between individual users, within or between user groups or institutions, or openly in our Open Science Portal.

The Dictator Game is used as a behavioral measure of generosity toward strangers, and the Trust Game is used as a behavioral measure of trust and trustworthiness toward strangers. Despite their wide use, the validity of these games has never been systematically evaluated. We will conduct an experiment to assess their internal consistency, test-retest reliability, external validity, and convergent validity.\nParticipants (N = 200) will be recruited through the University of Miami psychology student subject pool, through flyers posted around University of Miami, and through Craigslist and flyers posted around South Miami. Participants will play six Dictator Games And twelve Trust Games (six as investor; six as trustee) anonymously with other participants over a computer network. Afterward, they will have three opportunities to donate their earnings from the games to different charities. Participants will return to the laboratory at least two weeks later to complete the same tasks.\nWe will also collect self-reports and up to five peer-reports per participant. Both participants and peers will complete the self-report altruism scale, the trust facet of the NEO-PI-R, and a modified version of the Propensity to Trust scale. Participants will also complete life history measures and a shortened version of the Big-Five inventory. We will derive a measure of response acquiescence by positively loading each item on the Big-Five Inventory on one factor.\nWe will conduct an Exploratory Factor analysis, internal consistency analyses, test-retest correlations, correlations of aggregate game measures of generosity, trust, and trustworthiness with non-game generosity toward strangers, statistically controlling for the amounts in participants\u2019 accounts at the times of the three donation decisions. We will also correlate aggregate game measures with self-reports of generosity, trust, trustworthiness, life history, and response acquiescence.

The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making step-wise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for &lt;$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3- D printing community.\n\nThese files support the publication: A.

The Bayesian approach to cognitive development holds that children evaluate explanations by applying a normative set of statistical learning and hypothesis-testing mechanisms to the evidence they observe. Here, we argue for certain supplements to this\napproach. In particular, we demonstrate in two studies that children, like adults, have a robust latent scope bias that conflicts with the laws of probability. When faced with two\nexplanations equally consistent with observed data, where one explanation made an unverified prediction, children consistently preferred the explanation that did not make this prediction (Experiment 1). The bias can be overridden by strong prior odds, indicating that children can integrate cues from multiple sources of evidence (Experiment 2).

The second piece investigates the rationality of free agent contracts in their entirety by comparing the impact of lagged performance on total accumulated production and total dollar value paid. The goal is to determine if performance prior to contract year is underweighted in contract decision-making relative to its predictive power of future performance.

Steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPS) were recorded to measure the nonlinear combination of two sinusoidal gratings (1cpd and 3cpd in spatial frequency, respectively). They were orthogonally overlapped by themselves or by each other to form spatial frequency-matched (\u2018coherent\u2019) or non-matched (\u2018non-coherent\u2019) plaids. While fundamental SSVEP responses directly represent the components of a presented stimulus, intermodulation responses represent their nonlinear combination at the point of or after summation (Reits, 1980; Spekreijse &amp; Oosting, 1970; Zemon &amp; Ratliff, 1984). To reiterate, these intermodulation responses are not representative of the plaid 'presentation rate' (i.e. the frequency with which the two components become close to being temporally in-phase resulting in the perception of a plaid), but are phenomena generated by summation taking place in cortex that can be revealed by carrying out an FFT on the response waveform. Grating components were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies (4.6Hz, 7.5Hz) resulting in fundamental component-based responses at these frequencies, as well as intermodulation responses at their difference (7.5 - 4.6 = 2.9Hz) and sum (7.5 + 4.6 = 12.1Hz). When the grating components formed a non-coherent plaid, the sum intermodulation responses were small (if present) compared to when they formed a coherent plaid. This may represent differences in suppression from cross-orientation masking between the plaid conditions, or it may reflect selectivity for stimulus coherence. In support of the latter, the extent of fundamental response suppression that occurred for coherent and non-coherent plaids was similar.", "title": "Using the Intermodulation Term as a Measure of Selective Responses to Coherent Plaids"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zjdpe", "text": "", "title": "Lighting to make you feel better: improving the mood of elderly people with affective ambiences"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/frmzg", "text": "We investigated how satisfaction, alternatives, and investments in a relationship influence commitment differently for individuals in long-distance relationships compared geographically close relationships.

Converserarily, participants can find out allocation to the intervention simply by experiencing AEs. PC-RCTs were participants in placebo and intervention groups have a marked different frequency of AE reporting may easily become unblinded.\n\nWhy it is important to do this research:\nUnblinded randomized double blinded clinical trials become internally invalid. Unblinded outcome estimates for the treatment effect are biased (Hr\u00f3bjartsson 2013). Still, regulatory entities such as the Federal Drugs Agency (FDA) and others require PC-RCTs for drug approval. Also, systematic reviews pile up this biased evidence creating clinical guidelines that may further distort the real clinical picture of pharmaceuticals.\n\nObjectives:\nWe want to test for indirect evidence for unblinding by examining AEs profiles in placebo and intervention groups. An unpublished, preliminary analysis we did, found a large effect of congruent AEs profiles leading to smaller treatment effect sizes. However, this analysis is restricted to one specific field os sexual medicine: PDE-5 inhibitors. With this pilot, we want to broaden the scope and sample across a wide range of pharmaceutical interventions and research what other factors may explain AE profile congruency. We test the hypothesis that within an PC-RCT, more congruent AE profiles across intervention and placebo groups lead to smaller treatment effect sizes.", "title": "Congruency of adverse effect profiles in RCTs predict treatment effects: pilot study"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kjnmb", "text": "", "title": "Workplace Bullying and Mental Health"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ujm8d", "text": "", "title": "Past Meetings"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c9yra", "text": "This publicly accessible archive contains materials related to the annual meeting of the Society for Mathematical Psychology.", "title": "Society for Mathematical Psychology (SMP) archive"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p3xwr", "text": "", "title": "Examining psychopathy from an attachment perspective:  The role of fear of rejection and abandonment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/crfx8", "text": "", "title": "A&amp;M Replication Supplement"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nhfx6", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/muvl6", "text": "", "title": "Communications"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/689ns", "text": "", "title": "analysis code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4gx78", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cqt5z", "text": "", "title": "Presentation code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jcrie", "text": "", "title": "Study materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/enc6p", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/j65vr", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p8vuk", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xtsq6", "text": "This is an independent replication as part of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology.", "title": "Replication of E van Dijk, GA van Kleef, W Steinel, I van Beest (2008, JPSP 94(4), Exp. 3)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/t3b5m", "text": "", "title": "R analysis code"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/m5ciw", "text": "", "title": "raw data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ijk8w", "text": "", "title": "Stimuli"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/8x5vc", "text": "", "title": "raw data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7k4fr", "text": "", "title": "Stimuli"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p7va5", "text": "Change in implicit &amp; explicit attitudes towards lesbian women &amp; gay men from 2006 to 2013", "title": "Implicit preferences for straight people over lesbian women and gay men weakened from 2006 to 2013"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/esa57", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d28tr", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4rycq", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/aczvt", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Nurmsoo &amp; Bloom (2008, PS, Study 1)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zv3i7", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kw9s4", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4kiuz", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/v3eri", "text": "", "title": "Data and Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/y2f49", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2gkjt", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Ratliff (Ranganath) &amp; Nosek, 2008, Psych Science"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3ht5q", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pc6ze", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wgdkh", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5dx4v", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Larsen & McKibban (Psych Science, 2008, Exp. 2)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mcsb5", "text": "", "title": "Analysis Audit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c35gd", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d9ybf", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/mjasz", "text": "", "title": "Replication of Winawer, Huk, & Boroditsky (Psychological Science, 2008)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ne9dy", "text": "Materials are collected by COS.

According to Lakens, Schneider, Jostmann, and Schubert (2011), classification performance is affected by physical distance between response keys \u2013 indicating a cognitive tendency to represent categories in spatial code. However, previous evidence for a key distance effect (KDE) from a color-naming Stroop task is inconclusive as to whether: (a) key separation automatically leads to an internal spatial representation of non-spatial stimulus characteristics in participants, or if the KDE rather depends on physical spatial characteristics of the stimulus configuration; (b) the KDE attenuates the Stroop interference effect. We therefore first adopted the original Stroop task in Experiment 1, confirming that wider key distance facilitated responses, but did not modulate the Stroop effect as was previously found. In Experiments 2 and 3 we controlled potential mediator variables in the original design. When we did not display instructions about stimulus-response mappings, thereby removing the unintended spatial context from the Stroop stimuli, no KDE emerged. Presenting the instructions at a central position in Experiment 4 confirmed that key separation alone is not sufficient for a KDE, but correspondence between spatial configurations of stimuli and responses is also necessary. Evidence indicates that the KDE on Stroop performance is due to known mechanisms of stimulus-response compatibility and response discriminability. The KDE does, however, not demonstrate a general disposition to represent any stimulus in spatial code.\n\nPublished: March 18, 2014\nJonas, M., Eloka, O., Stephan, J., &amp; Franz, V. H. (2014).

In two different datasets covering 34 countries, economic growth was not associated with increases in happiness when it was accompanied by growing income inequality. Earlier instances of the Easterlin Paradox (i.e., economic growth not being associated with increasing happiness) can thus be explained by the frequent concurrence of economic growth with growing income inequality.

Its central assumption is conditional independence of the indicators given the latent class, i.e. \u201clocal independence\u201d; violations can appear as model misfit, often leading LCA practitioners to increase the number of classes. However, when not all of the local dependence is of substantive scientific interest this leads to two options, that are both problematic: modeling uninterpretable classes, or retaining a lower number of substantive classes but incurring bias in the final results and classifications of interest due to remaining assumption violations. This paper suggests an alternative procedure, applicable in cases when the number of substantive classes is known in advance, or when substantive interest is otherwise well-defined. I suggest, in such cases, to model substantive local dependencies as additional discrete latent variables, while absorbing nuisance dependencies in additional parameters. An example application to the estimation of misclassification and turnover rates of the decision to vote in elections of 9510 Dutch residents demonstrates the advantages of this procedure relative to increasing the number of classes.", "title": "Beyond the number of classes: separating substantive from non-substantive dependence in latent class analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/yrm85", "text": "The aim of this low-cost randomized control trial (RCT) is to utilize administrative records to evaluate the population-level impact of the Durham Connects newborn nurse home visiting program on mother and child emergency department utilization through child age 24 months.", "title": "A Low-Cost RCT of a Universal Postnatal Nurse Home Visiting Program: Durham Connects"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/v5rc7", "text": "", "title": "Barriers to Access: Effecting change in the admission process at your institution"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zyx4w", "text": "Whether, when, and why perceivers are able to accurately infer the personality traits of other individuals is a key topic in psychological science.

Namely, optimistic individuals may be more likely to believe that there will be a desirable outcome than less optimistic individuals.  The purpose of the current study is to examine the relationship between dispositional optimism and decision-making behavior when risk is present.  To investigate whether optimism was associated with risky decision-making, we examined the relationship between three aspects of optimism (dispositional optimism, attributional style, and trait hope) and risk-taking behavior on the IGT for 61 participants (M age = 19.62).  Correlational analyses between the three measures of optimism and the IGT indicate that they are weakly and not significantly related to one another.  A broader perspective on the factors that influence decision-making is necessary so that the mechanisms that predict and explain risky decision-making can be better understood.", "title": "Optimism is Weakly and Not Significantly Related to Decision Making"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/iwwjy", "text": "In this project we investigate the relation between keeping a secret and estimating hill slant.", "title": "Secrets and slant estimation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6yuxk", "text": "Template for participating labs in the Finkel RRR.

At a predefined time, all of them will focus mentally on the PMT for five minutes by using personalized strategies. These group of participants will contribute to ten experimental sessions carried out in different days. Ten control sessions without mental interaction recorded on the same days of the experimental ones, will be compared with the experimental sessions. \nA typical session will consist of: 80 minute for the cooling of the PMT + 40 m pre MI + 5 m of group MI + 55 m post-MI [experimental session] + 40 m + 60 m [control session]. To avoid any experimenter effect, the control and experimental periods will be randomized with the experimenter acting on the PMT blind about the period of the MI. \n\nParticipants will agreed with the co-author John Kruth(JK) of the Rhine Research Center Bioenergy Lab, the day and the time to start and end each session. In the agreed day, JK, will activate the PMT and the participants will start their 5 minutes mental interaction after 120 or 220 minutes in randomized way from the start of the recording time.\nAll MI periods will be carried out in the participants\u2019 home. All participants will be connected each other by using ooVoo\u2122 video chat.\nBefore the beginning of the session all participants will see some images of the Rhine Research Center, the Bioenergy Lab and of the PMT to have a representation of the site and the apparatus to influence.\nEven if free to adopt every strategies, the general instructions to influence the PMT will be that of getting mentally within it trying to emit light feeling completely at ease, protected from external disturbances.\n\nConfirmatory hypotheses: The number of photons detected by the PMT in the 30 minutes after the MI will outperform those detected in the 30 minutes before the MI.  \nThese differences will hold subtracting the number of photons in the corresponding 60 minutes of the control sessions.\nExploratory hypotheses: check if the above differences hold for shorter periods: 5,10,15,20,25 minutes and longer periods:35,40,45,50,55,60 minutes. \n\n\nThe comparison between the means of the photons x sec detected in the pre and post MI experimental periods and these differences with respect to the control periods will be done with a paired estimation of the means and the standardized effect size d by using the 95% confidence intervals obtained by a bootstrap procedure with 5000 samples and the calculation of the BayesFactorH1/H0, using the ttestBF from the package BayesFactor and fixing the prior effect size rscale parameter to 0.3. Furthermore the BayesFactor will be repeated varying the rscale parameter from .01 to 0.5 to check the robusteness of the effect. A BF above 3 will be considered as acceptable evidence.\n\n", "title": "Biophotons as physical correlates of mental interaction at distance: a confirmatory study."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/m8y9k", "text": "", "title": "Templated from Hypothesis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sdwy5", "text": "", "title": "Stigma Reduction: From Theory to Interventions"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wgc67", "text": "", "title": "Symposium on Gender Equality- Gender differences in reading from a cross-cultural perspective: the contribution of gender equality"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ij3qh", "text": "", "title": "Data files"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zcxji", "text": "Sample project created to explore OSF features in a production environment.

The human understanding of the world is deeply grounded in physical metaphors (Gallese &amp; Lakoff, 2005; Dijkstra et al., 2014). Commonly used phrases such as \u201ctaking a step back to think\u201d and \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d are rooted in bodily movement and are considered embodied metaphors; such that recreation of these phrases with physical movement may influence various forms of reasoning. These phrases seem to be rooted in the dual-process systems of human reasoning, a theoretical framework that describes System 1 as heuristic-based and intuitive and System 2 as analytic-based and deductive (Johnson-Laird, 2010; Gillard, Schaeken, Van Dooren, &amp; Verschaffel, 2011; Reyna, 2004).The objective of the current study is to investigate the reach of these embodied metaphors in human reasoning.", "title": "Taking a step back to think: Embodied Metaphors and Dual-Process Reasoning"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cz4as", "text": "", "title": "Implementation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/pkd65", "text": "", "title": "Strack Replication"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5hean", "text": "", "title": "Preguntas y Respuestas inteligentes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/satkn", "text": "", "title": "Monitoreando una ciudad hiperconectada"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gzpdj", "text": "", "title": "Centralizar la memoria hist\u00f3rica de las ciudades."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qhsrx", "text": "", "title": "Study 2 Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/quk9a", "text": "", "title": "ECR-RS Age Trajectories"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/e8pbt", "text": "", "title": "A Taxonomy of College Student Stressors and their Relationships with Student Strains and Success"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sqzh7", "text": "", "title": "Using water Megamasers to trace the temporal evolution of accretion disk structure in active galactic nuclei: the case of NGC 5765b, UBC 3789 and Mrk 1419"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/w7kz8", "text": "", "title": "Leader Prototypicality and Ratings: A Meta-Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3t79d", "text": "", "title": "Capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, show no evidence for inequity aversion in a costly choice task"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hrv37", "text": "", "title": "Predicting Future Events"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ea8vd", "text": "", "title": "Making the Leap: How Graduate School is different from Being an Undergraduate"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/sgzm7", "text": "", "title": "project narrative"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jh4ez", "text": "This replication and extension study is based on the 2012 research by Felmlee, Sweet, &amp; Sinclair.

The aIAT compares response times in associating the label \u2018True\u2019 to mutually exclusive categories of autobiographical events.  A person\u2019s specific autobiographical event can be identified by comparing their speed in matching generically true sentences (\u2018I am in front of the computer\u2019) and potentially true statements (e.g. \u2018I snort cocaine\u2019) with labels \u2018True\u2019 or \u2018False\u2019. A previous attempt (Vargo and Petr\u00f3czi, 2013) to utilize this measurement technique for the identification of cocaine users produced a high rate of false positives in a group of cocaine abstinent participants. This high inaccuracy was not observed in the group of cocaine using individuals.  Subsequent validation studies aimed to explore the potential reasons behind the measurement\u2019s inaccuracy.  Methods: Two versions of the cocaine aIAT were devised with different labels for the potential autobiographical categories (descriptive \u2018guilty/innocent\u2019 and self-referenced \u2018as if you were/were not a cocaine user).  Forty-one cocaine abstinent participants (43.9% male; mean age = 28.17\u00b17.36) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. As a control test, a complementary aIAT defined \u201cgender aIAT\u201d presenting \u2018as if you were a male/ as if you were a female\u2019 category labels, was also administered to all participants.  Self-declared cocaine abstinence was confirmed for the 12-month period preceding data collection through hair analysis.  Participants were also administered bespoke aIAT format implicit and explicit cocaine user attitude measures, a self-esteem brief IAT and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale.  Results: The cocaine aIAT category labels which elicited self-referenced knowledge showed low accuracy (19%) compared to the 65% of the \u2018guilty/innocent\u2019 labels. The self-referenced aIAT version significantly correlated with the self-concept measures (self-esteem IAT r(21)=.506, p=.019 and the Rosenberg scale r(21)=.508, p=.019).  In contrast, the gender aIAT produced very high accuracy rates (97%) even if category labels were self-referenced. The aIAT outcomes were independent of both implicit and explicit measures of attitudes toward cocaine users. Unlike the self-referenced cocaine aIAT, the gender aIAT was independent of both the implicit and explicit measures of self-esteem (r(41)=-.010, p=.950 and r(41)=-.044, p=.785, respectively). Conclusions: Category labels play an influential role in determining the cocaine aIAT\u2019s accuracy, demonstrating that participants\u2019 propositional knowledge and self-concept are involved during test performance.  The aIAT does not appear to tap directly into an individual\u2019s implicit memory when relevant memory is not available. The gender aIAT\u2019s very high efficacy suggests that the nature of the social knowledge inquired also determines the sensitivity of the technique. Overall, the aIAT presents itself as a very malleable tool which involves several cognitive functions simultaneously. As social knowledge appears to be highly influential on test outcomes, the potentials of the technique as a diagnostic tool should also be investigated.  Although the test cannot be recommended as a lie detector for identifying concealed life events (e.g. drug use), further research should investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to other potentials of the technique. \u200b", "title": "Me, Myself and Cocaine: Sources of Implicit Bias in the Autobiographical IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ey65c", "text": "", "title": "Enhancing Integrative Psychological Science as Interdisciplinary, Distributed, Team Cognition: Meeting the Challenge of Intercultural Differences"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bnup6", "text": "", "title": "Genetic diversity and gene flow in crop and wild carrot"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nrkfy", "text": "", "title": "SPSP Poster_2015"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/j24kf", "text": "", "title": "Necessary and sufficient conditions for implicit sequence learning: Evidence from task sequence learning"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g7zku", "text": "", "title": "Selective attention to social cues: context-dependent  modulations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zi6cp", "text": "", "title": "Spatial Visualization in First-Grade Children\u2019s reasoning about 2D and 3D Shape Representations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/d6mrw", "text": "", "title": "I Want to Be Heard!

Usually they are employed separately. The concurrent application of multiple research procedures might be beneficial in order to integrate insights coming from each approach. In this perspective, we carried out an experiment aimed at assessing the role of mental simulation, combined with the stimulation of the right and left prefrontal cortex (PFC) through tDCS, in enhancing creative thinking, meant as being able to imagine numerous unusual uses of common objects presented in visual format. Elder and Krishna (2012) showed that visually depicting a product and promoting different types of mental simulation resulted in more creative outcomes. Using tDCS with a similar protocol, Chrysikou et al. (2013) found significant facilitation effects of left PFC stimulation for figuring out uncommon tool uses. Our experiment, aimed at understanding better the role played by attitude, arousal and executive functions in creative thinking, was a 2 (site of stimulation: left vs. right PFC) x 3 (type of stimulation: anodal vs. cathodal vs. sham) x 2 (kind of mental simulation: creative vs. non creative) design. Forty-five adults took part to the experiment. Their creativity levels were assessed through a task of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. After 20 minutes of tDCS stimulation, they were presented with visual images of common objects on a neutral background. Half participants were instructed to visualize themselves while using the object in an unusual way, whereas the other half were just asked to visualize themselves while using the object. After the mental simulation task, aimed at inducing a divergent vs. convergent attitude, participants were asked to write down all the possible uses of the object they just saw. Participants\u2019 psychophysiological activation was recorded using a biofeedback equipment. Results showed significant interactions between stimulation site, type of stimulation and mental simulation: anodal stimulation of left and right PFC enhanced creativity after creative mental simulation, whereas cathodal stimulation decreased creative performance after non creative simulation.

Individuals seek fundamental stability in these connections as a way of understanding themselves and the external world (Heine, et al, 2006). Furthermore, humans have a unique inclination to perceive patterns to make sense of an otherwise stochastic environment and are susceptible to making illusory connections as a way of formulating a cause-and-effect relationship in the randomness surrounding them (Musch &amp; Ehrenberg, 2002; Heine et al, 2006; Blackmore &amp; Moore, 1994).When individuals feel they lack a personal sense of agency, they are likely to feel higher levels of anxiety from the vulnerability of losing this fundamental sense of stability (Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008). This vulnerability will cause individuals to seek connections through alternative, compensatory measures; they are likely to turn to external social constructions in an attempt to reestablish a sense of control over their environment (Kay et al, 2009). Individuals resort to alternative or familiar means of explanation as reassurance some external vehicle is responsible for random occurrences to regain structure in their connections within themselves and the external environment. It is hypothesized that a perceived sense of agency (control) influences an individual\u2019s beliefs in compensatory channels: superstition, conspiracy, religion, an interventionist God, paranormal belief, social institutions (ex, government).\n         Thus, the specific aim of this research project is to observe the effects of personal agency on pattern-perception and belief systems. It is predicted that a lack of personal agency in an individual will cause more pattern perception and an increase in beliefs associated with these compensatory channels. This study will use an experimental group that has been primed to feel a lack of agency with a \u201cconcept identification task\u201d and a control group that has not (further explained in procedures). This between-groups design will allow for comparison between these two groups in variables testing for pattern perception and belief.", "title": "Nostalgia for Unity: Compensatory Control and the Meaning Maintenance Model"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cwynr", "text": "", "title": "\ufeff\ufeffTailoring Mimetic Desires to the context: The role of Self-Monitoring and number of gazers in the evaluation of stimuli receiving others\u2019 attention"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hdy4a", "text": "Study on voluntary leadership in punishment and reward in a public goods game; including a number of personality characteristics and a reputation measure. \n\nThesis submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for a bachelor of arts in social sciences at Amsterdam University College.\n\nPosters presented at VSNU Student Research Conference 2013 (Leadership in Altruistic Punishment and Reward) and ICPS 2015 (Punishment Carries a Reputation Penalty Even When Pro-social), both in Amsterdam.\n\nWork completed with Prof. Mark van Vugt, Dr. Thomas Pollet (both VU), and Bobby den Bezemer (UvA).

Participants made more negative interpretations after exposure to the destiny article, and reported more satisfaction and commitment to their own relationship than after the growth article.

In both studies, as people reported higher concern about appearing prejudiced, the likelihood of overestimating the duration of African-American faces compared to White faces increased.

Across two studies, single individuals were given the opportunity to either accept or decline advances from potential dates who were either physically unattractive (Study 1) or incompatible with their dating preferences (Study 2). We found that participants were significantly less willing to reject these unsuitable potential dates when they believed the situation to be real rather than hypothetical. Across studies, this effect was partially explained by other-focused motives: participants for whom the scenario was hypothetical anticipated less motivation to avoid hurting the potential date\u2019s feelings than participants for whom the situation was real.

First, we present results of a large-scale replication of Sprouse, Sch\u00fctze, and Almeida (2013) on 100 English contrasts randomly sampled from Linguistic Inquiry 2001-2010 and tested in both a forced-choice experiment and an acceptability rating experiment. Like Sprouse, Sch\u00fctze, and Almeida, we find that the effect sizes of published linguistic acceptability judgments are not uniformly large or consistent but rather form a continuum from very large effects to small or non-existent effects. We then use this data as a prior in a Bayesian framework to propose a Small N Acceptability Paradigm for Linguistic Acceptability Judgments (SNAP Judgments). This proposal makes it easier and cheaper to obtain quantitative and statistically valid data in syntax and semantics research. Specifically, for a contrast of linguistic interest for which a researcher is confident that Sentence A is better than Sentence B, we recommend that the researcher should obtain judgments from 7 unique participants, using 7 unique sentences of each type. If all 7 participants agree that Sentence A is better than Sentence B, then the researcher can be confident that the result of a full forced choice experiment would likely be 75% or more agreement in favor of Sentence A (with a mean of 93%).

According to a social rank hypothesis, members of unequal societies are likely to devote more of their resources to status-seeking behaviors such as acquiring positional goods. Using Google Correlate and controlling for income and other socio-economic factors, we found that more than 70% of the 40 search terms that are used more frequently in unequal states were classified as referring to status goods such as designer brands, expensive jewellery and luxury clothing. In contrast, 0% of the 40 search terms that are used more frequently in more equal states were classified as referring to status goods.

Diener, Weiting, Harter, and Rashka (2010) conducted a study to explore the association between general well-being and income levels. Despite the general agreement on the presence of a link between income and happiness, there is still inconsistency in findings due to the extreme focus on developed economies (Graham &amp; Pettinato, 2002). The need for more studies is one of the reasons why replication is so imperative.The purpose of our replication is to increase reliability. Replication will determine how well the study was run, as well as the extent to which the results from the previous study can be generalized and applied to other settings.

An initial article reported that priming abstract linguistic categories (adjectives) led to more global perceptual processing, whereas priming concrete linguistic categories (verbs) led to more local perceptual processing (Stapel &amp; Semin, 2007). However, this report was compromised by data fabrication by the first author, and so it remains unclear whether or not linguistic category priming influences perceptual processing. To fill this gap in the literature, the present article reports 12 studies among Dutch and US samples examining the perceptual effects of linguistic category priming. The results yielded no evidence of linguistic category priming effects. These findings are discussed in relation to other research showing cultural variations in linguistic category priming effects (IJzerman, Saddlemyer, &amp; Koole, 2014a).

Aid Like A Paycheck could improve students\u2019 success in college and may also hold promise for making financial aid \u2014 whether federal, state, or private \u2014 more cost-effective by ensuring that aid is distributed to students while they maintain their enrollment.\n\nBecause Aid Like A Paycheck relies on existing financial aid dollars, it can be readily expanded to affect millions of students nationally. MDRC\u2019s upcoming rigorous evaluation of Aid Like A Paycheck will ensure that any resulting policy changes will produce the maximum academic and economic benefits for students, colleges, states, and the federal government.\n\nThis innovation grows from the Aid Success Project, a collaboration of MDRC and The Institute for College Access &amp; Success (TICAS). Since its inception in 2009, Aid Like A Paycheck has received the support of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Houston Endowment, the Kresge Foundation, and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and has generated keen interest from the U.S. Department of Education. Between 2010 and 2013, Triton College (Illinois) and Mt.

Some studies have recently suggested that this motor compatibility effect is larger when this cup is located in the peripersonal space (within reach) of the participants rather than in their extrapersonal space (out of reach). However, the action capabilities of other people might moderate this spatial dependency of the motor compatibility effect. Indeed, when the cup is located in the extrapersonal space of the participants but in the peripersonal space of a virtual person, the motor compatibility effect is larger than when this virtual person is absent.

Near Infrared Spectroscopy was used to register the response of 40 newborns' temporal regions when stimulated with speech, human and macaque emotional vocalizations, as well as auditory controls where the formant structure was destroyed but the long-term spectrum was retained.

Cronbach\u2019s alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach\u2019s alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach\u2019s alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires forgoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the dynamics of reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics and this distinction into account.", "title": "The alpha and the omega of scale reliability and validity: why and how to abandon Cronbach\u2019s alpha and the route towards more comprehensive assessment of scale quality"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ez8wj", "text": "A combination of the standard Faces/Places contrast and the Threat/Safety contrast, using fMRI.", "title": "Threat Safety Faces Places"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rvpq2", "text": "", "title": "Explanatory Scope Poster"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4r3uz", "text": "", "title": "Understanding heterogeneity in the effects of influence strategies on persuasion"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ivdk4", "text": "Raw data, Matlab Script, processed data, SPSS output and Materials relating to the data presented in the Psychological Science paper \"Blind Insight: Metacognitive Discrimination DespiteChance Task Performance\".", "title": "Blind Insight"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6i2ck", "text": "", "title": "Variability in perceived restoration: The role of visual and observer characteristics (SPSP poster)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/7gbfj", "text": "", "title": "Eye-Height Scaling in Memory (Twedt, Crawford, &amp; Proffitt, 2012)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6akvt", "text": "", "title": "Assessing the Robustness of Power Posing: No Effect on Hormones and Risk Tolerance in a Large Sample of Men and Women"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/chbgj", "text": "", "title": "DataONE: Using Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Compositions"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/c6bdz", "text": "", "title": "PLOS ONE: Using Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Compositions"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/m7xpc", "text": "", "title": "Fork of Temp Project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/468pu", "text": "This is an independent replication as part of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology.", "title": "Replication of K Dent, RA Johnston, GW Humphreys (2008, JEPLMC 34(2), Exp. 2)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hkyv8", "text": "", "title": "Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zg2su", "text": "", "title": "The Rules of Implicit Evaluation by Race, Religion and Age"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6ew4i", "text": "Repository for data, materials list, and protocol video for this project.", "title": "Transcriptional analysis of a whole-body form of long-term habituation in Aplysia californica"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g6hsy", "text": "", "title": "Project Talent (Damian et al., JPSP)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/rupg8", "text": "A plea for formal theory evaluation in the social and life sciences; \u00e6tiologies of developmental dyslexia as a case in point.", "title": "Beyond The Boundary"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nz3js", "text": "", "title": "Summary from Meetings"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/cw6y8", "text": "", "title": "Dataset"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5r639", "text": "", "title": "ZENK Expression Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/6kpjn", "text": "", "title": "Arrhythmic Song Exposure Increases ZENK Expression in Auditory Cortical Areas and Nucleus Taeniae of the Adult Zebra Finch"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2vz8c", "text": "http://www.spssi.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&amp;pageID=1884&amp;nodeID=1", "title": "Conference on the Great Recession and Social Class Divides"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/78qxm", "text": "in press, JPSP. Abstract: Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and Banaji (2009; GPUB) reported an average predictive validity correlation of r =.236 for Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures involving Black\u2013White racial attitudes and stereotypes. Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, and Tetlock (2013; OMBJT) reported a lower aggregate figure for correlations involving IAT measures ( r =.148). The difference between the estimates of the two reviews was due mostly to their use of different policies for including effect sizes. GPUB limited their study to findings that assessed theoretically expected attitude\u2013behavior and stereotype\u2013judgment correlations along with others that authors expected to show positive correlations. OMBJT included a substantial minority of correlations for which there was no theoretical expectation of a predictive relationship. Regardless of inclusion policy, both meta-analyses estimated aggregate correlational effect sizes that were large enough to explain discriminatory impacts that are societally significant either because they can affect many people simultaneously or because they can affect single persons repeatedly.", "title": "Statistically Small Effects of the Implicit Association Test can Have Societally Large Effects"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kez7x", "text": "", "title": "Study 4 - Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qpwkt", "text": "", "title": "Study 3 - Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/u7pws", "text": "", "title": "Study 2 - Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/kx3q9", "text": "My contribution to the Many Analysts: One Dataset crowdstorming project on racism in soccer refereeing.", "title": "Crowdstorming a dataset: Do soccer referees give more red cards to dark skin toned players?

In the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to quantify the effectiveness of AVGs. Only studies were included that used children or adolescents (&lt;18 years) as the population and assessed BMI as the outcome measure.\nMethod: A systematic literature search yielded 309 studies. Of these, only studies were included that used one or more AVGs were used as the intervention, compared the effects of the AVG with an alternative treatment control group or a no-game control group in an experimental design, employed BMI as an outcome measures, enrolled participants aged 18 years or younger, and comprised original studies. Nine studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.\nResults: The average effect of active videogames in children and adolescents was small to medium-sized and significant: Hedges\u2019 g  = 0.38 (95% CI: 0.00 - 0.77). Substantial heterogeneity was observed and moderator analyses showed that there were no significant effects of targeting only overweight or obese children versus targeting children of all weights. Non-significant effects were also observed for sample size, intervention duration and dropout. \nConclusion: The results of this meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence that active videogames can have positive effects on relevant BMI in children/adolescents.", "title": "The effect of active videogames on BMI among young people: A meta-analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zp93r", "text": "Materials to accompany the n-of-1 trial starter kit paper (European Health Psychologist, 2014)", "title": "N-of-1 trial starter kit"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/g6f2m", "text": "", "title": "Methods and Measures"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jtepu", "text": "The University of Chicago Crime Lab is conducting two closely-interconnected large-scale randomized social experiments in close collaboration with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), to learn more about the relative cost-effectiveness of investing in academic skills vs. non-academic factors that affect youth life outcomes, the synergy of investing in both domains simultaneously, and the key mediators and moderators of these effects.", "title": "Improving Life Chances of Disadvantaged Youth: Testing Best-Practice Academic vs. Non-Academic Supports Through a Large-Scale Randomized Control Trial in Chicago"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gfb26", "text": "", "title": "Preregistration"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ftphe", "text": "Article_EHP Bulletin August 2014", "title": "Testing Theory in Practice: The Example of Self-Determination Theory-based Interventions"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/2taig", "text": "", "title": "Pro-Eating Disorder Website Content Analysis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ntsbr", "text": "", "title": "Description of Method and Measures, Copy of Text Manipulation, Copy of Survey"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ybeur", "text": "", "title": "RRR\u2014Schooler & Engstler-Schooler (1990)"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/5xsiv", "text": "", "title": "Participating Laboratories"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/9cwnd", "text": "", "title": "Affective flexibility: Evaluative processing goals shape amygdala activity"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wh2b8", "text": "Using FPGAs to implement time-continuous complex dynamical systems such as coupled oscillators; chaotic systems...", "title": "Autonomous boolean networks on FPGAs"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/zf7c9", "text": "", "title": "Fork of Elliot, A.

This manuscript is currently under review at Frontiers in Psychology and can be ordered from markus.maier@psy.lmu.de. \r\n\r\nThe following Method will be used:\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\n\r\nSoftware and Computer\r\nThe study will be conducted using a HP Compaq 6005 Pro MT computer, a Samsung Sync Master 204B 20\u2019\u2019monitor (56Hz) and a HP keyboard. Eprime 2.0 software for designing psychological experiments will used for response registration and picture presentation. The left and right keys of the Eprime response box serve as response registration device. They will be placed at the table in front of the participants with the two response keys being centred to the midpoint of the computer monitor. The monitor will be placed at a distance of about 50 cm to the participant.\r\n\r\nStimuli\r\nThe stimulus pictures will be taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS] (Lang et al., 2008), which provides an experimental set of 1169 digitized photographs with normative rating scores (using a 9 point rating scale) on valence and arousal. A set of 10 extremely negative (mean = 1.73; SD = 0.27) and 10 neutral pictures will be  (mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27).\r\n\r\nExperimenters\r\nOnly informally trained undergraduate research assistants will be used as experimenters. They will be double blind, i.e., they will not know anything about the goal of the study, nor danything about the pictures used in this experiment.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nEach participant will be tested individually in a quiet lab room. Light will dimmed in the windowless room. The study described here will be the final experiment in a series of three studies. the first two studies will last about 20 minutes. After the completion of the two studies, participants will be informed about Study 3. A written instruction will presented on the screen: \r\n\r\n\u201cIn the following experiment you have to press two keys on the response box as simultaneous as possible. You will see this instruction on the monitor\u2018s screen:\r\n\r\nPlease Press the Keys\r\n\r\nWhile seeing this instruction, please press both keys as simultaneous as possible!\r\n\r\nAfterwards colored stimuli will be presented which you should simply watch.\u201d\r\n \r\nAfter the participant had read the instruction, the experimenter explains that the participant should put the index fingers on the left and right keys of the response box. Both keys will be placed on the table in front of the participant exactly at the same horizontal position as the midpoint of the computer screen. The experimenter emphasizes that both index fingers should slightly touch the cursor keys throughout the experiment, and once the command appears, they should press both keys as simultaneously as possible. Participants will be informed that there is no rush, but the response should be made spontaneous, and that after the key-press they should simply watch the following presentation of a colored stimulus. \r\n\r\nEach trial starts with the key-press command presented on the screen. Once the key-press was performed, the command line disappeares and after a 500 msec delay with a black screen, a masked positive or negative picture will be presented. The masked picture presentation consists of three consecutive stimulus presentations. First, a masking stimulus will be presented for 72 msec, followed by the presentation of a negative or positive picture for 18 msec, again followed by the same mask for 72 msec. Each negative and positive picture will be combined with an individual mask. The masking stimulus was constructed by dividing the original picture into small squares that were randomly re-arranged. The resulting mask consisted of the same color and lightness properties as the original picture and could therefore effectively mask the content of the picture ensuring a subliminal presentation. After the second masking stimulus had disappeared, a 3000 msec inter-trial interval appeares before the key-press command initiated the next trial. A total of 60 trial presentations will be used in this study. The 60 experimental trials will be preceded by three practice trials with neutral pictures helping the participants to familiarize themselves with the task. \r\n\r\nThe trial randomization procedure:\r\n A quantum based number generator (QRNG) from id Quantique will be used which can be found at www.idquantique.com. This hardware device passed both DIEHARD and NIST tests of randomness and is actually one of the most powerful ways to generate true random numbers (Turiel, 2007). Using this device, for each individual session, a random list of 60 bits (0/1) was constructed and stored. Each bit corresponded to one trial in our experiment in the order it has been created initially, i.e., trial 1 was related to the first bit, trial 2 to the second, etc. In addition, during each trial, directly after the key press of the participant the RNG that was connected to the computer randomly will create another bit (0/1). Since Quantis is not operating with a buffer, it was ensured that the actual bit used is always created after the key-press. The combination of initially created bits from the list and the actual RNG then define whether a negative masked picture will appear after a left or after a right key-press. \r\n\r\nSample size and data analyses:\r\nFor sample size estimation, data collection and data analyses, we will follow the suggestions made by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers (made in a previous review and in personal communication). His suggestions are printed with his permission:\r\n\r\n1. Bayesian analyses, with a one-tailed approach and a r = .1 from the Cauchy distribution will be performed.\r\n\r\n2. After a minimum of 50 subjects, the Bayes factor is monitored continuously after each subsequent participant (i.e. after n=51, again after n=52, etc.) until it supports H0 or H1, passing the threshold for strong evidence (10 and 1/10).

ABSTRACT: Personal goal achievement in the health and social domains is important for optimal aging and is influenced by older adults\u2019 environments and daily experiences. This analysis explores how experiencing notable daily events with relevance to health goals or social goals can facilitate or hinder daily goal progress. We expected that experiencing notable positive events that have relevance to both health goals and social goals would predict higher goal progress in both of those domains on the day of the notable event, compared to days with no notable events or days with events that were not related. We also expected that experiencing notable positive events with relevance to only the health goal or only the social goal should predict more progress for that respective goal, but not higher progress for the goal in the opposite domain. The analysis uses data collected from the Personal Understanding of Life and Social Experiences (PULSE) Project, a 100-day internet-based study of 99 older adults (age 52-88) in which daily measures of health and social goal progress were self-reported. Preliminary multilevel random coefficients models showed that a notable positive event facilitates health goal progress if the event was relevant to the health goal (B = 7.29, p &lt; .001) or both goals (B = 6.79, p &lt; .001). Similarly, a notable positive event facilitates social goal progress if the event was relevant to the social goal (B = 11.49, p &lt; .001) or both goals (B = 8.72, p &lt; .001). However, experiencing a notable positive social event significantly impedes health goal progress on that day (B = -2.32, p &lt; .01). A similar effect reaches marginal significance with respect to social goal progress, as a notable positive health related event marginally decreases social goal progress (B = -2.13, p = .08). We also analyzed the dynamic coupling of health and social goal progress, and found that notable positive events related to both health and social goals amplified the coupling of health and social goal progress on that day (B = 2.63, p &lt; .01), compared to a day with no event or a non health or social event occurred. Importantly, we found neither health goal progress to be impeded by a notable negative social event, nor social goal progress to impeded by a notable negative health event on that day. These results highlight the domain specific importance of notable daily experiences for older adults\u2019 personal goal achievement. The process of goal facilitation identified here elucidates a successful goal setting strategy that could be used to enhance goal progress across domains and over time.", "title": "When life gets in the way: Daily events and regulating goal progress in older adulthood "}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p8drs", "text": "", "title": "Perceived Risk and Emergency Preparedness: The Role of Self-Efficacy"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/f6t8v", "text": "", "title": "Mindfulness meditation and relaxation differentially improve mindfulness and affect, not emotional memory."}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/qky96", "text": "", "title": "Predicting Personality Disorder Symptoms from the MMPI-2 Psychopathology-Five Scales"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/jaqws", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/79ez8", "text": "", "title": "Survey"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gpcje", "text": "", "title": "Hypotheses and Analysis plan"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/xj2ti", "text": "This project explores the feasibility and costs associated with expanded bus service in Rexburg Idaho.", "title": "JPPS Bus Service"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gq3mp", "text": "", "title": "Research Report: Exploring the Existence of Parapsychological Constructs: Replicating the Effects of Precognition and Retroactive Recall"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/j2fp7", "text": "", "title": "HSRB and HSRB Appendixes"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/agkx4", "text": "", "title": "Data"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/p9cdq", "text": "", "title": "References"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/wrevi", "text": "", "title": "Data Analysis Plan"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ugend", "text": "Effort to replicate results of Bianchi (in press).\n\nhttp://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/06/0956797614532818.abstract", "title": "Replication of Narcissism and Unemployment"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ixysj", "text": "This study tests the effect of self-distancing (see Kross et al., 2014) on interpersonal moral judgment using the loyalty dilemma (Sowden, 2014).

Limited heterogeneity was observed and no moderator analyses were performed. For the effect of active videogames on functional balance in the elderly, the analyses revealed a medium-sized and significant effect of g = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.13 \u2013 1.24). For the elderly studies, substantial heterogeneity was observed. Moderator analyses showed that there were no significant effects of using a no-treatment control group versus an alternative treatment control group, or of using games that were especially created for health-promotion purposes versus off-the-shelf games.

Research has demonstrated that there are four primary reasons for this: tuition and associated costs, insufficient academic preparation, personal non-academic obstacles, and social and institutional obstacles. While survey evidence suggests that the latter two sets of impediments are important, current approaches have focused primarily on costs and academic issues. We propose to evaluate an innovative intervention, Stay the Course, that builds on the existing literature by focusing on the less-studied barriers. Stay the Course assists low-income students in dealing with personal and social barriers to educational attainment in two ways: comprehensive case management and emergency financial assistance (EFA). Case management includes holistic, wrap-around counseling designed to identify students\u2019 personal roadblocks and help them manage the educational progress. Professional case managers will coach students through their challenges and help them navigate the community college environment. EFA provides financial support for unforeseen crises threatening a student\u2019s ability to stay in school, such as a medical emergency, a broken down car, or lost work due to an illness. The objective of this exploratory study is to initiate a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation to assess whether this innovative intervention increases community college persistence and completion rates. Eligible students will be randomly assigned to receive either both case management and EFA, just EFA, or neither. The central hypothesis we will test is that an intervention that directly addresses personal, non-academic and social-institutional barriers will increase community college persistence and completion rates. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) to determine the short term impact of providing comprehensive case management and access to EFA on community college persistence and completion rates; and 2) to determine which types of students benefit the most from participation in the program. The expected outcome of the study is that the benefits of case management and EFA services will be quantified using a true experimental design. This study is innovative because it presents an opportunity to evaluate an intervention addressing personal and social/institutional obstacles to degree attainment, areas largely ignored by prior research.", "title": "Stay the Course: An Innovative Approach to Increasing Community College Persistence and Completion Rates"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/4dsgt", "text": "A Many-Facet Rasch Measurement analysis will be used to disentangle the contribution of specific associations to the overall IAT measure.", "title": "Implicit sexual attitude: the contribution of specific associations"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/fk9z5", "text": "", "title": "Procedure and Instrumentation"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/ra293", "text": "", "title": "Hypothesis"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/u6kad", "text": "", "title": "Project"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bmrx7", "text": "", "title": "False Memory Trait Data and Materials"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/hj6da", "text": "Registered replications of important results in psychological science", "title": "Perspectives on Psychological Science\u2014Registered Replication Reports"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/s6r3j", "text": "", "title": "Young People-Old People IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/gajby", "text": "", "title": "Wisdom-Innocence IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nu8ex", "text": "", "title": "Vegetables-Meat IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/bgkxp", "text": "", "title": "Urban-Rural IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/3cbbk", "text": "", "title": "United States-Japan IAT"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/y6e9m", "text": "The aim is to compare the build-up and release of proactive interference (PI) using verbal materials and abstract visual imagery, in order to determine whether proactive interference affects verbal and visual representations in working memory similarly.", "title": "Proactive interference in verbal and visual working memory"}, {"tags": "", "url": "http://96.126.107.189/nmxz7", "text": "Sandstrom, G.M., &amp; Dunn, E.W.

We will try to provide empirical data about the utility of a diagnosis tool used to assess memory impairments in patients with AD. The same memory task will be presented in three different ways. The task contains 16 unrelated words. Group 1 will learn the words with individual semantic cues for each item both during encoding and during immediate recall. Group 2 will learn the words with semantic encodng but not during immediate recall. Group 3 will learn the words without semantic cues. After delayed recall, all the participants will be asked to recognized which words were studied when presented individually along with 24 foils. Sixteen of these foils will be related with the 16 target items, whereas 8 foils will be unrelated. We expect that different patterns of encoding will show different benefits of recognition.

We know empirically that there exist mappings whereby (L4+L3) < L1.  Furthermore, we know that there are mappings where (L4+L3) become arbitrarily small. \r\n\t\r\n\tIt easy to show that it is impossible to compress all streams of size N bits to N-1 bits:\r\n\t\r\n\tAssume that the program can compress without loss all files of size >= N bits.  Compress with this program all the 2^N files which have exactly N bits.  All compressed files have at most N-1 bits, so there are at most (2^N)-1 different compressed files [2^(N-1) files of size N-1, 2^(N-2) of size N-2, and so on, down to 1 file of size 0]. So at least two different input files must compress to the same output file.  Hence the compression program cannot be lossless. (Much stronger results about the number of incompressible files can be obtained, but the proofs are a little more complex.) \r\n\t\r\n\tThe argument above shows that it is not possible to find a transformation certain to compress any arbitrary stream.  However, the task is not to compress arbitrary streams.  The task is to compress \u2018streams of interest\u2019.  The streams of interest in this case are any data that might likely form a meaningful message.  \r\n\t\r\n\tOur hypothesis is that there exists a \u2018reachable\u2019  vector space whereby incompressible data streams of interest map to compressible data streams.  \r\n\t\r\n\tIf we were to determine that there were \u2018only\u2019 2^1024 (a very large number) streams of interest and found a suitable algorithm, all streams could be tokenized to 128 bytes in length, regardless of the length of the source.  This theoretical limit is not likely to be reachable, but we speculate that by essentially building robots to explore various spaces, we may be able to find suitable spaces that allow gains over current methods of compression.\r\n\t\r\n\tAt the current time, no technology exists which is capable of finding and exploiting these spaces and indeed it is not even known if they exist in such a way that they lend themselves to a general data compression tool.\r\n\t\r\n\tOur goal is to create a technology that will allow us to find and exploit vector spaces that yield meaningful compression.  Our approach is a technological/empirical one.  By building tools to explore the results of transformations we accomplish two things.  First, we leverage our chances of stumbling upon promising vector spaces by automating searches using compute time.  Second, should other researchers discover appropriate transformations, or the constraints of current technology change , we will have tools available that are ready to exploit the breakthroughs.\r\n\t\r\n\tIt has been more than sixty years since Huffman published \"A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes\". Since then, there have been tremendous changes in computer science, particularly hardware and software.  However, current general compression is little better than it was back then .  We believe this is testimony to the difficulty and hence the uncertainty of solving the problem.
