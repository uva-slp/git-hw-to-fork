drunkenly drifting
blowing reckless sound regrets
polished poltergeists

bleary waif roaming
barracudas bloating pond
raining, gently, wet

oozing carving bloats
harpsichord fights icily
shakily, cask shines

weakly mewling moon
races, alabaster shadow
ills awkwardly brave

elves encircle, numb
deferential scarecrows blur
juicily, horse melts
