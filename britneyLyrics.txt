Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killin' me
(And I)
I must confess I still believe
(Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you've got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

My loneliness is killing' me
(And I)
I must confess I still believe
(Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness is killin' me
(And I)
I must confess I still believe
(Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

(I must confess)
My loneliness is killin' me
(That my loneliness is killing me now)
I must confess I still believe
(Don't you know I still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
(That you will be here)
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
